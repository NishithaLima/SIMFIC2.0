 Is there any doubt that Jimmie Dale was a gentlemanâ"an INNATE gentleman? he said whimsically; âthat would never do. he asked incredulously. âGranted,â? âHe was the most puzzling, bewildering, delightful crook in the annals of crime,â? âI donât quite get the connection. âI was a reporter when he first broke loose, and the ambition of my life, after I began really to appreciate what he was, was to get himâ"and I nearly did, half a dozen times, onlyâ"â? âYes,â? commented Jimmie Dale. he said earnestly. âYes, by Jove, youâre right!â? He worked alone, absolutely alone. âHe was the prince of crooks and the father of originality,â? announced Carruthers abruptly, following the pause that had ensued. âCarruthers,â? âNot to-night, Jimmie,â? âI must,â? âHello, Jason,â? âYes, sir,â? âI was going to bed, sir, at about ten oâclock, when a messenger came with a letter. âJasonâ?â"Jimmie Dale flung out the interruption, sudden, quick, imperativeâ"âwhat did she look like?â? âVery ladylike, sir, in her dress and appearance, and what I would call, sir, a beautiful face.â? commented Jimmie Dale, with a curious tinge of bitterness in his voice. âYes, sir,â? âJason,â? If ever she comes here again, inveigle her in. As it isâ"whereâs the letter?â? âJason,â? he said kindly, with a swift change of mood, âyouâve been a long time in the familyâ"first with father, and now with me. âMaster Jim,â? SHE! And then he had gone too farâ"and he had been caughtâ"by HER. And then had followed those years in which there had been NO temporising, in which every plan was carried out to the last detail, those years of curious, unaccountable, bewildering affairs that Carruthers had spoken of, one on top of another, that had shaken the old headquarters on Mulberry Street to its foundations, until the Gray Seal had become a name to conjure with. And then, a block ahead, on the other side, his eyes rested on an approaching form. âBolted,â? This way and that the two men reeled, staggered, swayed, panting and gasping; and thenâ"they had lurched back close to the office doorâ"with a sudden swing, every muscle brought into play for a supreme effort, Jimmie Dale hurled the other from him, sending the man sprawling back to the floor of the office, and in the winking of an eye had slammed shut the door and turned the key. Well, well, strangeâ"isnât it?â? And you work for Isaac Brolsky in the secondhand shop over on West Broadwayâ"donât you?â? âThey donât generally,â? he said numbly. âI wonât make any trouble. She was ill, critically ill; it needed no trained eye to discern a fact all too apparent to the most casual observer. he said brokenly. And there wasnât any money for the medicine, andâ"and the things she had to have. âI knew theyâd know it was me in the morning when old Isaac found it gone, because there wasnât anybody else to do it. Say, Iâm no detective. Gee, kid, did you think I was? Say, listen to this! âCrook,â? Well, so longâ"Hagan.â? âHello!â? âHello! Oh, that you, Carruthers?â? âYes,â? again, and call it off? was! âYes, Master Jim,â? âNot the young person, begging your pardon, not the young lady, sir. âVery good, Jason,â? Which? How? Of courseâ"Carruthers! âHello?â? he said. âHello! âYes,â? âCarruthers,â? he said peevishly. Where are you? Yes? âBenson,â? he said tersely to his chauffeur, âdrop me one block this side of the Palace on the Boweryâ"and forget there was ever a speed law enacted. âVery good, sir,â? Take Carruthers, for instance. he said. âHello, Carruthers!â? he said; and, linking his arm in Jimmie Daleâs, turned the corner, and headed west along the cross street. A bit morbid, you know, and all that sort of thing. he said. Now, here we are. Keep close to me, and Iâll pass you in.â? Hâare you, Carruthers? âGlad to know you, Mr. Matthewson,â? âNow, then,â? âTake a good look. âNow, then,â? âI was saying,â? he said, âthat Metzer was to come to headquarters at eight oâclock this evening. he grinned. Sure, Iâve got him.â? he said. Yâre all right, sportâ"yâre all right. he said reproachfully, âyou certainly made a mark of us both. âIt wasnât drawn for reproduction, Carruthersâ"at least not yet,â? he asked blankly. You canât have it, old man, so letâs think about something else. âYes,â? âVery good!â? âI donât understand.â? he said, in a low tone, âthat I want your word youâll get that photograph into my hands by to-morrow afternoon, no matter what transpires in the meantime. âNeither,â? Who was it that would have access to the gray seals in the possession of the police, since, obviously, it was one of those that was on the dead manâs forehead? And then Jimmie Dale smiled mirthlessly, with thinning lips. he insisted; âanâ de harness bulls only just found it out.â? he said hoarsely. âDe fly cops,â? And then the rush passed, and swept on up the stairs. âHe was broke,â? he said grimly, shaking his head. he said. âYes, I got it. Thanks. . . . Yes. . . . . . . No, noâ"no! . . . How? . . . . . . Yes. . . . . . . YES. . . . Jason, well-trained servant, closed the door behind them. âHello, Carruthers; hello, inspector,â? âTake this chair, Carruthers.â? âGlad to see you, inspectorâ"try that one in front of the desk, youâll find it comfortable.â? he remarked, with a grin. âYes,â? he said slowly, a grim intonation in his voice, âgoing to draw youâ"TRUE TO LIFE.â? âNo more, no less. No? he stormed. Well, it wonât workâ"and Iâll make you squirm for this, both of you, damn you, before Iâm through!â? he sneered, as he started for the door. I tell youâ?â"his voice rose shrillyâ"âit was Stace Morse.â? he said, in a fierce monotone. You canât send another there in your placeâ"this time. And you seized on the fact of Stace Morse having paid a visit to him this afternoon to fix the crime onâ"Stace Morse. Oh, yes, I know youâve manufactured proofs enough to convict himâ"if there werenât stronger proofs to convict YOU.â? he said softly. Yes? Now you may look at this, Clayton.â? he said calmly. I am sure they are more so nowâ"excitement, you know. âLampblack,â? Your thumb print, Clayton. Of course, there are a dozen other points of similarity equally indisputable, butâ"â? âYes,â? he screamed out. Of course heâd deny he was the Gray Seal, just as heâd deny that he was guiltyâ"but Iâd have the proof both ways andâ"and Iâd collect the rewards, andâ"andâ"â? âNO, you cur!â? âRead it to him, Carruthers.â? âNow,â? he said uncompromisingly. Pure selfishness,â? âTheyâd guy me unmercifully if they ever heard of it at the St. James Club. The honour is all yours, Carruthers. Yes? he echoed, as though invoking the universe. âI remembered that you had said last week that the Gray Seal never left finger marks on his workâ"and I saw one on the seal on Metzerâs forehead. And then, I took a dislike to Clayton somehowâ"and put two and two together, and took a flyer in getting him to handle the notebook. âIt wasnât nice of you, Carruthers, to turn on the Gray Seal that way. You leave it to me. You see, a man canât help his eyes being beady or his nose pronounced, but pomposity and a smirk, nowâ"â? âHello, Markel!â? âFact is,â? he said a little frigidly, âI donât believe in this sort of thing. Eh, Carruthers?â? âYes, I should say youâre right, Markel,â? he agreed judicially. âNo,â? âNo, nothing like that!â? he said brusquely. he said, as he rose from his chair. âYes, I see,â? âCarruthers,â? âNo,â? he said bluntly. âYes,â? âNo, of course,â? âHome, Mr. Dale?â? he asked cheerily, touching his cap. âYes, Bensonâ"home,â? Yes. Yes. Yes. âBenson,â? he said crisply, âI am going downtown again later on, but I shall drive myself. âVery good, sir,â? âYes, Jason.â? âYes, sir,â? And then, finally, he slowed the car to a snailâs paceâ"he should be very near his destinationâ"that very ultra-exclusive subdivision of Charleton Park Manor. commented Jimmie Dale to himself, as he went on again, âit will do admirably.â? And then, a hundred yards farther on, Jimmie Dale nodded his head in satisfactionâ"he was passing the rather ornate stone pillars that marked the entrance to Charleton Park Manor, and on which the initial promoters of the subdivision, the real-estate people, had evidently deemed it good advertising policy to expend a small fortune. And thenâ"alert, strained, tense in an instant, Jimmie Dale crouched against the wallâ"and then he smiled a little grimly. Yes, there it wasâ"the door, at least. Put the screws on at once. The light went outâ"blackness fell. And then silence. And then again that cough from aboveâ"a prolonged paroxysm of it this time that went racketing through the house. âIt was really thoughtful of you, Markel, to buy that this afternoon!â? There came a murmur of voices. And then, within a few feet of the door, Jimmie Dale halted abruptly, as a womanâs voice rose querulously from the hallway above: âYou are making a perfect fool of yourself, Theodore Markel! âI was a fool to bring the confounded thing home. And then Jimmie Dale had snatched the revolver from the floor where Markel had dropped it in the scuffle, and was pressing it against Markelâs foreheadâ"and Markel, terror-stricken, had collapsed in a flabby, pliant heap. âI donât like you, Markel,â? he said, with cold impudence. he screamed hysterically at the servants. âNow, get up yourself!â? he announced coolly. âHelen,â? For Godâs sake, do as he says!â? he requested, with ironic deference. Yes, thatâs right!â? Fifty yards or so more, and Jimmie Dale halted. No? Quite so!â? âY-yes,â? âNo,â? There can be no possible misapprehension on your part nowâ"Markel?â? Your name is Wilbur, Henry Wilbur, isnât it?â? âYes,â? âYes,â? âNo,â? Mr. Carruthers, please. Yes. . . . Oh, you knew that, did you? Well, so much the better; youâll be all the more keenly interested to know that it is no longer in his possession. . . . Oh, yes, I quite forgotâ"this is the Gray Seal speaking. . . . Yes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Yes. . . . âReally,â? Iâ"â? I am a ruined man, absolutely ruined. He persisted. Naturally, I told him my story. The first ten thousand wasnât enough. As it isâ"I default the noteâ"Markel attaches all I have left, which is the mine. he said, in a low voice. âPaste,â? âTo Markel,â? âIn a month or two or three, as the case may be,â? âI donât understand. âI wish I knew,â? And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders in consonance with a whimsical change in both mood and thought. And then, as he walked, involuntarily, insistently, his mind harked back into the old groove again. 15,836! 15,836! And the smile left his lips, and upon his face came the look of a chastened child. And then, as she came to the door and turned the key on the inside: âPray Heaven she doesnât turn the light outâ"or somebody might think I was trying to break in!â? She did not turn out either of the gas jets that lighted the little shop; instead, in a faltering, reluctant sort of manner, she led the way directly through the door in the rear, and the man followed her. It opened into a short passage that, after a few feet, gave on a sort of corridor at right anglesâ"and down this latter, facing him, at the end, the door of a lighted room was open, and he could see the figure of the man who had entered the shop, back turned, standing on the threshold. âSammy! Sammy!â? he said gravely. the other answered steadily. âI see you recognise it,â? âSammy! Sammy!â? âSammy, say you didnât do it!â? corrected the other, without raising his voice. he said in a low tone. Thenâ"then Iâm done!â? he said, a touch of sternness back in his tones again. he screamed out. Kline, Mr. Kline,â? Let him off, let him go! Her arms were around his knees now, clinging there. âMy poor woman,â? he said kindly, placing his hand on her head, âyou are talking wildly. âIt will kill himâ"it will kill my boy. And you can save him! he said huskily, and stooped and raised Mrs. Matthews to her feet. âYes, yes!â? she cried, trying to smile through her tearsâ"and then she flung her arms around her sonâs neck again. he said weakly. the other interposed heavily. Say,â? he said suddenly, with a catch in his breath, âIâ"I donât think I know what Iâm doing.â? she said brokenly, âWhatâ"â? And then suddenly, in spite of caution, his foot slipped on the bare floor. she said, more to herself than to Jimmie Dale, and hurried across the floor to the door as she spoke. âI must have turned the key in the lock without shutting the door tight,â? âYes,â? he agreed, with a smile. she answered; and, evidently anxious to be rid of him, moved quickly around behind the counter. âEgyptiansâ"any kind,â? he said pleasantlyâ"and went out. And then the smile left Jimmie Daleâs lips, his face grew strained and serious, and he broke into a run down the block to Sixth Avenue. âNo, sir,â? âYes, sir,â? commented Jimmie Dale to himself. Without moving the bolt, he turnedâ"and his flashlight for a moment swept the room. âNot much like the way they describe this sort of place in storybooks!â? âI donâtâ"â? Why not! Two more men, in answer to the summons, came up into the room. announced one of the three. âHello, Cap, whereâd you raise the mustache?â? he said curtly. Say, Capâ"â? See?â? âEasy enough,â? he said offhandedly. âIt was like falling off a log. Aw, it was easy. Of course, he knew well enough he was innocent, but he could see the twenty years I showed him with both eyes. And then the old woman came across with an offer of fifteen thousand for the plate, and corrupted me.â? âYes,â? âYes, quite soâ"but the plate? âThey will raid to-night. When? And then he swervedâ"into the next alleywayâ"that flanked the Sanctuary. Higgins, you take the one above. âYes, sir! Very good, Mr. Kline,â? was the response. And then, thumping down the creaking stairs, they stopped before Jimmie Daleâs room. âI donât know who he is any more than what you can see there for yourself,â? âYes, sir but the fellow, whoever he is, couldnât get away from there. âOne,â? Three. âFive,â? And then for the first time Jimmie Dale movedâ"to wipe away the beads of sweat that had sprung out upon his forehead. âJason,â? âYes, sir,â? âBut, sir, it ainât thatâ"good Lord, Master Jim, it ainât that, sir! And then, sir, there ainât been an hour gone by all through the day that a woman, sirâ"a lady, begging your pardon, Master Jimâ"hasnât rung up on the telephone, asking if you were back, and if I could get you, and where you were, and half frantic, sir, half sobbing, sometimes, sir, and saying there was a life hanging on it, Master Jim.â? How? When? Where? âYes, sir?â? Of course! âVery good, Jason,â? he said quietly. You can expect me when you see me. âIn a word,â? Jason, for that matter, would be the only one likely to be about; the other servants would have no business there in any case, and whether in their quarters above or below, they had their own stairs at the rear. âI must speak to Jason about being a little more watchful,â? Yes, there it wasâ"the letter. No, a change was not to be thought of. âYes, yes!â? âHello! And then one hand, resting on the desk, closed around the edge, and tightened until the skin over the knuckles grew ivory white. She! he said hoarsely. âYes, Iâve got itâ"itâs all rightâ"itâs all rightâ?â"the words would not seem to come fast enough in his desperate haste. Jason, still running, headed for the desk. âHello! âHello! . . . Who? . . . . . . . . . . . . âJason!â? Jason, still overwrought and excited, obeyed a little awkwardly. âYes, sir,â? âNo, sir,â? âJason!â? âYes, sir.â? âI wish you to remain where you are, without leaving that chair, for the next ten minutes.â? he said. ââBout midnight,â? The first house on the right-hand side, with the room-to-rent sign, her letter had said. . . . . . . . . . And the next morning the papers would rave with execrations against the Gray Sealâ"for the robbery of the life savings of a poor, defenseless old man, for committing as vile and pitiful a crime as had ever stirred New York! Oh, yes, they would know it was the Gray Sealâ"the insignia was familiar enough; familiar to the crooks of the underworld, who held it in awe; familiar to the police, to whom it was an added barb of ridicule. And then, about to open the door, a sort of sudden dismay fell upon him. And the latter were outside now in the corridor, running to their accompliceâs aid. Let him have it! Get the Gray Sealâ"the reward thatâs out for him is worth twice the sparklers, andâ"â? Above, they had not yet reached the skylight. The fire escape was there. And then, as he ran, Jimmie Dale snatched the mask from his face and put it in his pocket. She was thereâ"but he could not recognise a face that he had never seen! She was too clever, far too clever for thatâ"she, too, would know that he could and would recognise her voice where he could recognise nothing else. And then, suddenly, he realised that he was attracting attention. As Larry the Bat he had met the Wowzer many times, as indeed he had met and was acquainted with most of the elite of the underworld. He hurried on. And then a cafe, just ahead, making a corner, gave him the opportunity that he sought. âI wonder if itâs just a flukeâ"or something else? The first would not light. And then gradually impulse gave way to calmer reason, and he slowed his pace to a quick, less noticeable walk. There could be no doubt of that. As Larry the Bat he knew every den and lair below the dead line, and he knew, too, the Wowzerâs favourite haunts. Time! She was safe. he announced brusquely. âGlad to know youse, cull!â? He said dis place was on de level, anâ I could always find him here, datâs all.â? âIt wouldnât have been as easy to fool old Chang as it was that fellow back at the Dragonâ"and, besides, if I can work it, thereâs a better chance this way of getting out alive.â? he announced; then held up his hand for silence. he said impressively, âthis is one of the most notorious, if not THE most notorious dive in Chinatown, and it is only through special arrangement with the authorities and at great expense that the company is able exclusively to gain an entree here for its patrons. And then, as cautiously as he had opened it, he closed the door behind him, and stood for an instant listening at the head of a ladder-like stairway, his automatic in his hand now. And drunk, both of themâ"and both in a blind fury! Well, keep âemâ?â"he shoved his face forward. Say,â? Well, when Iâm ridinâ in me private buzz wagon, Wowzer, youse stick around anâ mabbe Iâll tell youseâ"anâ mabbe I wonât!â? And then it seemed to Jimmie Dale as though pandemonium, unreality, and chaos at the touch of some devilâs hand reigned around him. And the room itself began to spring into weird, flickering shadows, that mounted and crept up the walls with the spreading fire. They gave way before his rush, tumbling back in their surprise against the opposite wall; and, turning, Jimmie Dale raced down the passageway. And then, behind, the Wowzerâs voice shrieked out: âSoak him! Put a hole in him, deâ"â? And then, as he ran, Jimmie Dale gave a little gasp of relief. âQuick!â? Lord, the irony of it! So, after all, there was time yet! This was the house. And then, silent as a shadow in his movements, the door left just ajar behind him, he stole down the carpeted hallway. âYes,â? âI want to see Mr. Thomas H. Carling, cashier of the Hudson-Mercantile National Bankâ"itâs very important,â? he said, in a low tone. âTake a chair,â? he said, over his shoulderâ"and then, turning in the act of dropping into his own chair, grasped suddenly at the edge of the desk instead, and, with a low, startled cry, stared across the room. A bit melodramatic, isnât it? âMy mask is only for effect,â? he said. âYes,â? Iâ"â? he sneered. And then, from first one pocket and then the other, Jimmie Dale took the two packages of banknotes, and, still with out a word, pushed them across the desk until they lay under the otherâs eyes. âExactly,â? âI found it hidden in the home of one of your employees.â? âMoyne, eh?â? âI want you to listen to a little story first.â? âI refuse!â? âI wonât have anything to do with it.â? And the muscles of his jaw were quivering, his words rasping, choked with the sweep of fury that, held back so long, broke now in a passionate surge. I tell you, you lie!â? he rasped on. And then Jimmie Dale laughedâ"not pleasantly. âYes, thereâs a way, Carling,â? he said grimly. âI wonâtâ"I canâtâ"my God!â"Iâ"Iâ"WONâT!â? he said under his breath. âNo, no!â? âCarling,â? âTake this pen,â? And then, even as Jimmie Dale sprang forward, the other pitched head long over the couchâ"and in a moment it was over. And there was another way nowâ"since the man was dead. commented Jimmie Dale to himself. And underneath, in the scrollâ"a motto. âYes,â? Quick, alert now, anxious even, he pulled the double, folded sheets from the envelope, glanced rapidly through themâ"and, after a moment, a smile, whimsical, came slowly to his lips. All this was extraneous, apartâ"for another time, when every moment was not a priceless asset as it very probably was now. As Larry the Bat? him because he was âsafe,â? And young Burton, the letter had said, was Maddonâs private and confidential secretary. And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrank still closer against the wall. And then he located the soundâ"it came from the other side of the lane and very nearly opposite to where, on the second floor, a dull, yellow glow shone out from old Isaacâs private den in the rear of the pawnshopâs office. And then the frown relaxed, and he smiled a little. Above, facing him, a door was open. âNo, I didnât! I tell you, I didnât! âNo, no, Isaac, I didnât mean that. I tell you I couldnât do it this afternoonâ"I tell you I couldnât. You see how little I askâ"and I pay well, do I not? he sneered. Is it not soâ"eh? And then, very slowly, in an automatic, machine-like way, his hand groped into the inside pocket of his vestâ"and old Isaac cackled out in derision. So! Yes, yes; you did well. âYes, I took them.â? The light reflected back as from some living mass of crimson fire, now shading darkly, now glowing into wondrous, colourful transparency as he moved the case to and fro with jerky motions of his handsâ"and he was babbling, crooning to himself like one possessed. Yes, yes; these are the ones! This is the great Araconâ"see, see, the six-sided prism terminated by the six-sided pyramid. Ah, it is too badâ"too bad! he said coolly; âyou know them all! Quite so, Isaacâ"but be good enough to DROP them!â? And then, while one hand with revolver extended rested easily on the table, the other gathered up the stones, placed them in the case, and, the case in his pocket, Jimmie Daleâs lips parted in an uninviting smile. âNot too close, Isaac!â? âI know YOU!â? All thieves, eh? âIsaac,â? They are all alike. âVery well, Iâll make a bargain with youâ"providing it is agreeable to your young friend here.â? Is it not so?â? And then his first suspicion passedâ"it was no âgameâ? He said heâd show you some real life, and you went with him to Sagostoâs. he said dully. He said Sagosto had told him of the murder, and had offered to dispose of the corpse and keep his mouth shut for fifty thousand dollarsâ"that no one in his place knew of it except himself. You told him you had no such sums, that you had no money. âYes,â? âI wonder,â? he said grimly, as he stood up, âif you ever saw this man before?â? âYes,â? âIt was simple enough,â? he said. âYes,â? he moaned. he said grimly. âYes,â? And then, with his back to Burton again, he took the case of gems from his pocket, opened it, and laid it on the cupboard shelf. âBurton,â? he said a little sharply, âwhile I was outside that doorway there, I heard you beg old Isaac to let you keep the rubies, and three times already you have asked the same of me. âI donât know what you mean by that,â? he said. âNo,â? âYes.â? âYes, I know,â? âYes,â? he said. he said quietly. For Godâs sake, donât play with meâ"the Gray Seal, the most notorious criminal in the country, to give back a fortune like this! âI donât understandâ"I CANâT understand!â? âThey say that youâ"and yet I believe you nowâ"youâve saved me from a ruined life to-night. You? Well, who knows, perhaps there have been others like you!â? âI donât mean anything at all,â? Are you ready?â? âWalk straight to the door,â? âNow, no noise!â? he instructed. he said brusquely, as he fumbled around for a moment in the darkness. âSo I believe,â? âHello! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Yes. . . . . . . Oh, quite so! . . . . . . You repeat that,â? . . . he said huskily. âI wonder what sheâll do when she finds Iâve got the ring?â? âWe should not be surprised,â? Dale, sir!â? he said. âVery good, sir,â? âYes, sir,â? He said it was important, and that you were to have it at once.â? âA boy, sir,â? âNot at all, Benson,â? And then, taking out the Tocsinâs letter, he laid it upon the table, placed what money he had in his pockets beside it, and began rapidly to remove his clothes. And the proofâ"he laughed aloud suddenly, unpleasantly. And there would be a sort of grim, poetic justice in it, a temptation almost to let the play work itself out to its own inevitable conclusion, onlyâ"Jimmie Dale, the final touches given to his features, stood up, and his hands clenched suddenly, fiercelyâ"it was not just the man higher up alone, there were the other three as well, the whole four of them, all of them, crimes without number at their door, brutal, fiendish acts, damnable outrages, murder to answer for, with which the public now was beginning to connect the name of the Gray Seal! âHello, Larry!â? ââEllo!â? This was Stangeistâs houseâ"he could just make out the building as it loomed up a shadowy, irregular shape, perhaps two hundred yards back from the fence. The light went out. And then, suddenly, every faculty instantly on the alert, he snatched up the envelope from the desk, and listened. And you tell The Mope I dock him five hundred for that extra crunch on Roessleâs skull. See?â? âNot so very!â? he said. he announced softly. he said sullenlyâ"and drew a match across the under edge of the desk with a long, crackling noise. he said hoarsely. âBlast you, Mope!â? he sneered. And then Clarie Deane laughed in a low, brutal way. he said innocently. âAw,â? So itâs in the vaults, eh?â? âYes,â? he choked. âI wonât!â? he said hoarsely. You can take yer choice. he said, trying to keep his voice steady, âsuppose I open the safeâ"what thenâ"afterward?â? he screamed out. he croaked. she shouted back at him. âNo-o,â? He choked. âLong Island,â? the other answered. âOh,â? But, thank God! Who was the Gray Seal? Who was the Gray Seal? There came the faintest creak from the stairs. Why not a more determined and prolonged effort at his doorâ"the visitor had been easily satisfied that Larry the Bat was not within. Well, it had been a piece of consummate egotism on his part, that was all. 148. And then Jimmie Dale stopped suddenly, and began to retrace his steps. This was already three-quarters open, and swung outward into the bedroom, near the lower end of the room by the window. 148, closing the door on his side until it was just ajar. âFive thousand down,â? âI seem to be in luck to-night. And then it seemed to me I heard some one in here mention five thousand dollars twice, which makes ten thousand, and which happens to be just exactly the sum I need at the present momentâ"if I canât get any more! âI see that I am,â? he said apologetically; âand yet not wholly unnecessary. he said gently. And then, in the centre of the room, Jimmie Dale stood motionless, staring around him, an expression, ironical, sardonic, creeping into his face. âMy, but wasnât he cute!â? âI wonât get over it as long as I live!â? âI was going to bed,â? They gave now. You go back to the house, Mr. Mittel, and fix yourself up. was undoubtedly an exaggeration, anyhow. She was gaining unquestionably, steadily, but not as fast as he had feared. And then suddenly, with a swift, appraising glance behind him, he swerved the boat from her course and headed for the shoreâ"not directly, but diagonally across the little bay that, on the farther side of the point, had now opened out before him. As it is, I was afraid I would be late. âIt will be quite apparent to you that I have not time to prolong our interview unnecessarily, in view of the possible return of the police at any moment, but you might as well be comfortable. You seem to have eluded the police for the moment, somehow, but let me tell you Iâ"â? âNo,â? he remarked. he jerked out. âI know that,â? You can appreciate that. You are a curb broker, Mr. Mittelâ"ostensibly. Put them both in this box. Was it, at last, the beginning of the end? And the latter course he dared not even considerâ"the Sanctuary was still the Sanctuary, and the role of Larry the Bat was still a refuge, the trump card in the lone hand he played. ââEllo, Bristol,â? âI want him fast enough, butâ"â? Meâ"damn himâ"me, for all I know!â? echoed Whitey Mack passionately. Who is he, then?â? Say, forget it! Say, wake up! âI donât get you, Whitey,â? he said. âYes, if youâll do that itâs good enough for any man. Well, whatâs the use! See?â? Get me?â? âI get you,â? announced Whitey Mack, âhereâs my proposition, and itâs my turn to hand out the âlook-out-for-your-selfâ dope. There could be no question about that. Yes, or no? Quick, alert, he ran, crouching, bent down, along the alleyway, reached the side door, opened it stealthily, closed it behind him with equal caution, and, in the dark entry, stood motionless, listening intently. The intuition, if it were only intuition, was still strong. And then Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders. from somewhere came a low, quick voice. Which, out of all the crowd around him, was hers? As Larry the Bat, he knew the place well. And then, with a little start, he read the lines over again, muttering snatches from them. â. . . . .â? All this had appeared in the papers. Well, why not? who were in his own set, he knew it to be true. All this and more had flashed almost instantaneously through Jimmie Daleâs mind. Savvy?â? Let him get his paws on the sparklers.â? And then a low rasping at the window, like the gnawing of a rat; then, inch by inch, the sash was lifted. One, two, threeâ"ten. âNot yet, he hasnât!â? Know him?â? âTake a good look at him,â? he said again under his breath. âI require, say, fifteen minutes in which to effect my escape. âI agree,â? And the door had closed silently behind Jimmie Dale. Jason, poor chap, was in the hospital. The lights in the rest of the house, as witness the reception hall, were in order. This was no ACCIDENT! By whom? She was hereâ"here in his house! âNo,â? she said, in a low voice; âyou must not light that lamp.â? She was close to him, his hands reached out for her, touched her, and thrilling at the touch, swept her toward him. Is there any question about it, Jimmie? I tell you, noâ"a thousand times no!â? he said again, and took another step forwardâ"and stopped once more. he said hoarsely. she said simply. âYes,â? she said. âThey will never get you, Jimmie,â? she said, in a suppressed voice. âI do not know,â? she answered gently. he asked, and his hand reached out for her again through the blackness. âYes. I know,â? âYes,â? She was in HIS house. he said tersely. âNo,â? âYes,â? he said, with a grim smile; âI know Connie Myers.â? She was speaking quickly now. âAnd,â? she answered tensely. I do not know whether Connie Myers is alone in this or not; but I do know that he is going to Doyleâs house again to-night to make another search for the money. She was right! Why? he asked suddenly, aloud, âthey have not yet discovered the body?â? âNot yet,â? She was pushing him across the room toward the door. But go, now, Jimmieâ"go!â? âI will goâ"as I came.â? She was thereâ"somewhere back there in the darkness still. And then, like a cold shock, came that other thoughtâ"she who had trusted to his honour! he said heavily, and stepped out into the hall. She was goneâ"and ahead of him lay the chances of the night! And then, abruptly, he stole forward. And then Jimmie Daleâs form straightened rigidly on the stairs. She was on her knees, clasping his knees, imploring him, terrified. he said tersely. And then, having apparently emptied the receptacle, he wriggled his body over the dismantled fireplace, stuck his head into the opening, and peered upward. âKinks in his nut, kinks in his nut!â? he said huskily. Yours truly, A FRIEND.â? And then, quick, almost on the instant, came a rush of feet, a crash upon the front doorâ"an imperative command to open in the name of the law. And the shot, fired at random, the interior of the room hidden from the officers outside by the drawn shades, found its markâ"and Connie Myers, a bullet in his brain, pitched forward, dead, upon the floor. âYes,â? âQuick!â? âNot a sound now!â? And then, suddenly, like light through the darkness, came a ray of hope. âHagan,â? he said sharply, âpull yourself together, and listen to me! he whined. âI was just goinâ ter borrow the price of a feed from Mike Haganâ"lemme go!â? âHagan, eh!â? And you do what youâre told, or weâll put the screws on youâ"see? Who is it! âI donât believe it!â? she cried. âI donât believe it!â? She was staring now at Jimmie Dale. she cried. Well, whatever you told them, you lie! she said, in a choked, strained way pointing to the door. Why? By whom? Or was it safer to burglarise, as he had once done before, his own mansion on Riverside Drive? ââEllo, Chick!â? he said, out of the corner of his mouth. ââEllo, Larry!â? the other answered. âI was in dere meself. âSâlong, Chick!â? Then who? Was it? And there was the Tocsin! Who was she? And then, as Jimmie Dale lunged up from his chair to his feet to escape the rush, pandemonium itself seemed to break loose. And then came sudden darkness, as some one of the attendants in misguided excitability switched off the lights. And the policeâ"He stopped suddenly, as though he had been struck. And then a surging mob was around him on every side, and, pushing, jostling, half lifting him at times from his feet, carried him forward with its rush, and with him in its midst burst through the door and out into the street. Who I amâ"yes, and my name. This is not like one of my usual letters, is it? Yes, sir?â? he said curtly, and stepped into the cab. he said tersely. WATCH!â? And then a sort of unnatural calm settled upon Jimmie Dale, and his hand went mechanically to his pocket to feel his automatic there, as he turned again to the chauffeur. he said significantly. âThey are following us? You are SURE?â? âYes,â? he rasped out. âThey havenât got us yet, by a long way!â? he answered, through set lips. Oh, yes, he remembered now! And then, in a sudden flash, the details of the night came back to him. Boxâ"what was the number?â"yes, 428. Who was John Johansson? Who was this gentleman so quietly reading there at the desk? he said awkwardly. he said. he said stiffly. I shouted at the man. âIt would appear to be fairly obvious, I should say.â? âVery clever!â? commented the man. he said, and on the desk where his hand had been lay the Tocsinâs gold signet ring. âI want to know where the woman who owns this ring can be found to-night.â? he requested calmly. âIt will give you an extra moment or so to frame your answer,â? he said sarcastically. âSince I do not know who owns it,â? he said, âI cannot answer your question.â? You are evidently mistaking me for some one else. âDale,â? he said, with an ominous smile. I do not wish to be theatrical about this, but we do not temporise here. he said caustically. Well, Mr. Dale?â? Who was this man? âVery well, Mr. Dale!â? he said quietly. âI want to call your attention first, Mr. Dale, to the fact that as far as you are concerned you neither have now, nor ever will have, any idea whether you are in the heart of New York or fifty miles away from it. Now, listen! âI do not wish you to labour under any illusion. This is our home. Quite so, Mr. Dale. I do not wish to strain your credulity, or play tricks upon you; so I am going to ask you to fix an approximate idea of the length of the corridor in your mind, as it will perhaps enable you to account more readily for what may appear to be a discrepancy in the corresponding size of the rooms.â? And then suddenly, rubbing his eyes involuntarily, he was staring in a dazed way before him. We make it. âI do not want you to accept anything on trust.â? No! he asked politely. he said. he said softly. The lights came on. And then it seemed as though he could not move, as though he were rooted to the spotâ"-and the colour ebbed from his face. And then the leader spoke. Dale,â? he said, with cold significance, âI regret to admit that your pseudo taxicab driver was so ill-advised as to refuse to answer the SAME questions that I have put to you.â? âI will repeat the questions,â? he said sharply. I do not know who the woman is to whom that ring belongs, much less do I know where she is. And then his feet were jerked from beneath him, he crashed to the floor, and, in another moment, bound hand and foot, he was tied into a chair beside that other chair whose grim occupant sat in such ghastly apathy of the scene. he said grimly, âis no confession of weakness upon the part of those with whom you have had to deal here. All this will be quite within your province, Mr. Daleâ"and quite fruitless. There could be no truce, no armistice. announced the other briefly. he said curtly, âIâll tie this over your eyes.â? he answered caustically. And the hour instead, the hours since then, had brought a nightmare of events so incredible as to seem but phantoms of the imagination. And then Jimmie Dale, in the darkness, smiled again grimly as the leaderâs reference to the Gray Seal recurred to him. Why? And these clothes that he now woreâ"why had they made him change? Who was the chauffeur? And then for the second time the car slowed downâ"and this time the man on the seat beside Jimmie Dale reached up and untied the scarf. Jason, however, had left the light burning here in the big reception hall. It opened inward, if he remembered correctly. âJason!â? âJason!â? âJason, what are you doing here?â? âYes, sir. QUICK, man!â? âJason,â? Think, man! âNo, sir.â? âYes, sir,â? You see, as I said, Master Jim, I must have gone to sleep, butâ"â? Jason, white, frightened, bewildered, touched his lips with the tip of his tongue. he said hoarsely. Now, answer!â? he said. âYes, maâam, Mr. Dale has come in, but he has retired. . . . he instructed hurriedly. They arenât the ones you went out in, sirâ"they arenât yours at all, sir!â? âJason,â? âYes, sir,â? The light went out. âI donât see anything, sir,â? And then Jimmie Dale spoke again: âDo you see anything, Jason?â? Yes, sirâ"there he is again!â? âYes, sir; butâ?â"Jasonâs voice, low, troubled, came through the darkness from the upper end of the roomâ"âMaster Jim, sir, Iâ"â? âYes, sir. HOW! âJason,â? he said abruptly, as the other entered, âI want you to telephone for Doctor Merlin.â? âDo I look ill, Jason?â? âJason,â? âYes, sirâ"good Lord, sir!â? âNow, Jason,â? âYes, sir; I think so, sir.â? âYes, sir, thatâs right,â? he announced. âVery good,â? âYes, sir?â? Jason, at a sign, closed the door quietly. âBenson,â? he said, âthe back seat of the large touring car is hinged and lifts up, once the cushion is removed, doesnât it?â? âYes, sir,â? âNow, another matter, Benson: I believe some chauffeurs have a habit, when occasion lends itself, of taking, shall we say, their âbest girlâ out riding in their mastersâ machines?â? âSOME might,â? âYes, sir.â? âYes, sir,â? âVery good!â? âBenson,â? he said slowly, âdo you remember a night, nearly four years ago, the first night you ever saw me? âI remember,â? âI know that, Benson,â? âNow, you, Benson,â? I wanted you to be. You are to experience some difficulty in finding it again, move about a little to force any one that may be lurking by the garage to retreat around the corner. he said: âListed on that paper you will find a different rendezvous for each night for the next five nights, excluding to-night, which, after you have returned the young lady to her home, you are to pass by on your way back here. âYes, sir,â? âVery well, then,â? âNo, sir; not a thing,â? âNonsense, Jason!â? You go ahead now and stay with the servants, and get them out of the road at the proper time.â? he said calmly. âYes, sir.â? You are going too fast for me to jump, and I donât want them to notice any change in speed, except what is made in plain sight. Where are we, Benson?â? âYes, sir,â? And then the voice he knew so well, the Tocsinâs was whispering hurriedly: âI will be waiting here, Jimmieâ"for Larry the Bat.â? She was waiting for himâ"WAITING for him! And then he laughed out wildly, passionately. Noâ"it was true, it was real! I love you!â? I love you!â? She did not struggle. She was hisâ"his! And there came a mighty sense of kingship upon him, as though all the world were at his feet, and virility, and a great, glad strength above all other menâs, and a song was in his soul, a song triumphantâ"for she was his! And then her head was buried on his shoulder, and she was crying softly; but after a moment she raised her hands and laid them upon his face, and held them there, and because it was dark, dared to raise her head as well, and her eyes to look into his. And there was nothing incongruous in the rags that clothed her, in the squalour and poverty of the bare room, in the white furrows that the tears had plowed through the grime and make-up on her cheeks. she said, in a low voice. âI found the wires tapped,â? he said slowly. âYes, andâ"and the man you metâ"the chauffeur?â? âHe is dead,â? âI do not know,â? âYes,â? And then the pent-up flood of questions burst from his lips. Who was the chauffeur? And the Crime Club? And the issue at stake? âNo, Jimmie; not that way. âI must know now, if I am to help you!â? she said, almost as though she were talking to herself; then, with a swift intake of her breath, impulsively: âJimmie! she answered gravely. I do not know how many. she said evenly. And there had beenâ"he leaned quickly, tensely forward over the table, staring at her. âYes,â? she said quietly. She was Marie LaSalle! âI want to tell you in as few words as I can,â? she said abruptly, breaking the silence. I do not know who those men were. âIt was a very simple will,â? she answered. he prompted. she said, hesitating a moment. Now about my uncle. âYes,â? he said briefly; âI surmised as much.â? And then she was speaking again: âFatherâs death occurred very shortly after my uncleâs message advising us to postpone our trip was received. You are, perhaps, expecting me to say that I took a distinctive dislike to him from the moment he arrived? she cried out in a low, passionate voice. This was even before my supposed uncle came. The lights were all out. Why, you fool, what are you trying to doâ"hand me one! And then I recognised Hilton Traversâ voice. she said. I crept into the library. Both of them! she said. âTravers,â? âIt would take too long to tell you all that passed between us,â? And then, Jimmie, I came toâ"this, I have lived like this and in different disguises, as a settlement worker, as a widow of means in a fashionable uptown apartment, but mostly as you see me nowâ"for five years. And there was nothing, Jimmie, nothing anywhere, and I had no successâ?â"her voice choked a little. You can understand now how I came to know the strange things that I wrote to the Gray Seal, how the life that I have led, how this life here in the underworld, how the constant search for some clew on my own account brought them to my knowledge; and you can understand now, too, why I never dared to let you meet me, for I knew well enough that, while I worked to undermine my fatherâs and my uncleâs murderers, they were moving heaven and earth to find me. âI do not know,â? she answered. âI do not know,â? she said again. And then she turned away her head. Time! Time! Time! She did not speakâ"the question, that meant life and death to them both, was in her eyes. âNot yet!â? he said. he insisted. âYes,â? she said. âYes,â? she said again. he said musingly, at last. And the telephone as an explanation isnât good enough.â? she said earnestly, âpossible or impossible, it is nevertheless true. he said crisply. âBut, at best, you could only watch him a very small portion of the time.â? he asked quickly. she said quietly. âNo,â? he answered, after an instant. âNot that I know of.â? She was credited with being a sworn enemy of the police, andâ"yes, he remembered, tooâ"with having done âtimeâ? herself. âI donât quite understand,â? he said, in a puzzled way. she answered gravely. You see now how and why I became known as Silver Mag. Wellâ"do you see now, Jimmie? he said, under his breath. he said bitterly. he said, with a mirthless laugh. When? Where? he said positively. âI see,â? âYes,â? she said. he queried, a little blankly. she said monotonously. âYes,â? she said, and shrugged her shoulders in a tired way. she cried. âNo,â? she said frantically. You see now, donât you? she saidâ"and there was a glad, new note in her voice, âthen, Jimmieâ"Jimmie, we are safe! You can get it, Jimmie! âYes,â? he said tersely. he said grimly. And then it came againâ"a low sound, the sound of a stealthy footstep just outside the window that faced on the storage yard. âI donât know,â? she answered, in a whisper. âNo,â? he said quickly. Let him in. ââEllo, Larry!â? ââEllo, Slimmy!â? he said, in a conciliating tone. he said tersely. Are youse on, or ainât youse?â? he said gruffly. Well, wot do youse say, anâ say it quickâ"âcause if youse ainât cominâ in, youse can beat it out of here soâs I can talk to Mag.â? Sure, I am! âAw,â? Get me?â? he said, with a wink. And then, in a flash, the answer came. echoed the Magpie, with a short laugh. he said shortly. WAS THIS, TOO, A PLANT? And then, the next instant, as the Magpie spoke, his suspicions were allayed. See?â? he announced. she said anxiously. Well, why not? âYes, youse willâ"NOT!â? announced the Magpie, with cold finality. Now youse listen to me, both of youse. Get me? he said thoughtfully. I tell youse, I got to! snorted the Magpie, in disgust. Get me?â? âSlimmy,â? Well, so long, Slimmyâ?â"he slouched eagerly to the door. And then, with sudden decision, taking his hesitation, as it were, by the throat, Jimmie Dale hurried on againâ"to the Sanctuary. And then Jimmie Dale smiled almost apologetically. Yes, there were the scratches that the tools had left; and, as though in sardonic jest, the holes, where the steel bit had bored, were plugged with putty and rubbed over with some black substance that was still wet and came off, smearing his finger, as he touched it. NO! And then, halfway to the door, he halted suddenly, and stood stillâ"listening. âI know,â? âGlad to know you, gents,â? Yes? Get it for me, will you, Spider?â? Quick, noiseless, he stole along the side of the wall, reached the corner, and slipped in behind the curtain, as Spider Jack, striking a match, entered the room. he said meaningly, over his shoulder, as he stepped toward the rear door. he said. âI wonder,â? he said grimly. And then slowly, a grim, hard, merciless smile came to his lips. And then he swayed a little, and his face grew gray. he said hoarsely. he said mechanically. And then, a moment later, safe from observation: âJimmie, Jimmie, what is the matter? he said. she insisted wildly. And then, with a violent effort, Jimmie Dale forced his mind back to the immediate present. he asked, with quick apprehension. âNo,â? she said. âBut, Jimmieâ"â? And you were both to be here at three. You are not yourself. Of course, he remembered now! âQuick, Jimmie! âIt was there,â? he said, as though the words were literally forced from him. Thenâ"WHAT, Jimmie?â? âThey got it,â? he said. She did not speak or moveâ"save that her hands, as though nerveless and without strength, fell away from his arms, and dropped to her sides. And there was misery and fear and a pitiful helplessness in itâ"and then she swayed a little, and he caught her in his arms. For Godâs sake, donât do that!â? she said in the same monotonous voice, âit would have been better ifâ"if I had never found out anything, and theyâ"they had done the same to me that they did toâ"to father.â? she said. She did not cry. he said, with a steady smile. âNo, Jimmieâ"no!â? He said it involuntarily, more to himself than to her. she said again. âNo,â? he said. she answered. âNow, listen,â? he said quietly. âYes,â? she said. she said tremulously. And then, not daring to trust his voice, he released her suddenly, and stepped back out from under the stoopâ"and the next instant he was across the deserted avenue. And then, as he stood there, strained, listening, the silence itself began, it seemed, to palpitate, and pound, pound, pound, and be full of strange noises. And then in the darkness, as he stole noiselessly across the hall, he shook his head. All this would help. And then Jimmie Daleâs head, ear pressed close against the safe to catch the tumblerâs fall, was liftedâ"and the flashlight played again on the dial. And then, at lastâ"a gasp of relief: âAh!â? This was an easier matterâ"far easier. The first room on the rightâ"THAT manâs room! The first room to the right, therefore, should be just at his hand. Ah, what was that? And then suddenly every muscle grew strained and rigid. That, too, was obvious! Who was he? And then, too, there might well be another reason. Or was it all wild, fanciful imagination? NO! Well, it was their move! You damned snitch, Larry!â? And then Jimmie Dale was on his feet. he said, with a cold smile, âwhen Iâve settled with youâ"for the murder of Henry LaSalle.â? Why, you fool, I LIVE here! Fifth Avenue. Get them all, get them all, damn them!â"do you hear?â"get them all! Yes, yes, he must go! This was a longer, more arduous task. Yes, the step was nearer nowâ"at the head of the stairsâ"on the landing. And then there came a low voice: âJimmie! Are you there? Quick, Jimmie! Are you there?â? âTheyâre coming, Jimmie!â? They are on their way here, now! So, Jimmieâ"quick! âYes,â? he said quietly. You go at once. You cannot go like thatâ"can you? he said. Go at once, Marieâ"while you can. For Godâs sake, go now!â? âNot without you, Jimmie.â? You cannot take any chances now, Marie. She was staring at him, a strange wonder in her face. But goâ"go, Marie!â? she said simply. Why not! Without a word, he ran back across the room. She was standing there by the door, listening. âThey are coming, Jimmie!â? she called, in a low voice. he said, under his breath. And they were only the vanguard of what was to come! And then it seemed that pandemonium broke looseâ"there was a volley of shots, the bullets splintering through the door panels as from a machine gun, so fast they cameâ"and then another rush against the door. And from the street, a low, sullen roar. And then a curious, ominous crackling soundâ"and then the smell of smoke. And then a low, bitter cry came to his lips, and he clenched his hands. he said quietly. And then all was blind madness. Yes, that was itâ"rest.
