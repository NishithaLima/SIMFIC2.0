 They are deep in conversation upon the common theme. They point to the girl, and the appeal is not in vain. 'An' she's Welsh, yer honour. she inquires, turning to the bystanders. 'Tis tiert all out she is, my leddy. 'Och, my leddy, shure we're starvin' there. 'Help the poor girl, and come with me.' An' shure, my leddy, she's a thrue Welsh name. I'll help ye, my darlin', there! The young man who was kneeling by the girl just now, goes to her other side, and succeeds in supporting her by putting his arm round her waist, whilst the woman holds her by one arm; and thus they follow the good mistress of the farm, followed in their turn by the rest of the party. 'Come here, Tom,' cries the mistress, authoritatively. 'Spread some more, and shut the window in the loft.' 'Go to sleep, indeed! 'I didn't mean to say you were angry, only I thoughtâ"' 'You thought what?' 'Hush, Davy! 'Indeed, I am very sorry. 'No, I 'ont, and that's plain speaking!' Here, all was confusion and consultation. 'Niver a frind in the worrld, yer honour.' 'How can we send her?' 'Yes, David?' 'Do what you like, only get rid of 'em somehow.' Indeed, few monarchs are as independent, and proud of their independence, as David Prothero of Glanyravon. 'In the barn, master,' answered a man, who was eating bread and cheese on the gate, and swinging his legs pleasantly about. All the Irish are gone except the girl, Davy, bach' said quiet Mrs Prothero, 'and they are gone to the Overseer to tell him about her, and I will see that she is sent to the workhouse to-night, that is to say if I can.' They are going into Herefordshire to get work, and she, poor thing, is looking for her relations in this county, and meant to get work here.' 'I can't make things neater, Davy.' Now, name o' goodness, let's have some breakfast.' You have neither been to church nor chapel, and scarcely eaten a morsel all the day. 'I wouldn't care if your father was at home; but I don't quite like to have her into the house without his leave, and she is not fit to be left in the barn.' 'Into the house, mother! 'Oh, my dear child! 'Never, I'm sure, in that kind of way.' I shouldn't wonder if she brought a famine with her.' The young man did not interfere, probably being aware that it is better to let two women finish their own quarrel. Again, however, they were interrupted by the appearance of a fourth, and more animated personage. How do you do, Netta?' no, of course I don't.' 'No, certainly not, but I know by heart all she has to say.' 'Can I help you, Mrs Prothero? 'You are with friends, and in God's hands,'said Rowland gently, as the eyes languidly reclosed. Dear me, how wretched that poor girl looks.' 'You, child! 'Oh, papa! 'If we ask him, we must ask Netta. 'She seems to me to understand her own interests, papa, as well as most people. 'Do you think it wise, my dear, to put yourself so much on a level with Miss Prothero, as to invite her?' It will be a source of pride and satisfaction to her, without making her presume more than before; and the vicar and his lady will like the attention.' His genealogies are too much for me.' Only the one is more fashionable than the other. They are cousins of the Protheros, Mrs Jenkins being Mr Prothero's first cousin, and the members of the younger generation being consequently second cousins. no such thing. Squander, squander! 'I, Uncle Griff! Promise me to be lending him a hand, if he do keep constant to your sister.' Would you like me to read to you, and pray to Almighty God, for Christ's sake, to change his and all our hearts?' 'I didn't be wanting a parson, but a relation, sir; and I don't be going to die yet. Mind you, I 'ont die yet, but I tell you, because I can trust you; and Howel don't know nothing.' 'No, no. 'And the box of gold?' Mind you, not to Howel nor to 'Lizbeth: promise me.' Only think how soon you may be called to your account, to say exactly how you have employed your time, and the talents givenâ"' 'I have done plentyâ"plentyâ"all out at interest, at five, six, even ten per cent. Think; oh think, of the great Judge, and great Mediator. Still, she was free, with competence, she hoped, in perspective? 'Come you, don't you be takking on so,' said one old woman soothingly, as the widow rocked herself to and fro, and held her handkerchief to her eyes. You would think a small music warehouse, a miniature tobacco shop, or branch depot of foreign grammars and dictionaries were before you. He did very well at college, but gained no greater honours than the respect and goodwill of those he was known to. At home, he is understood by few. 'Handsome is that handsome does.' 'I only wish to advise you for your good, now that you are your own master. 'Why not now?' Oh, Howel! But I cannot weep or pray as some people can.' no, never.' 'Do you think me a fiend, sir, that my name cannot be mentioned to my cousin? 'How is that poor girl, Netta?' 'Certainly.' 'I'm sure I scarcely know whether she will behave rightly,' muttered Miss Gwynne, tapping her hand with her riding-whip. 'You good, clear Mrs Prothero!' I am really very sorry. Mother, poor Griffith Jenkins is dead. 'Just as he lived, mother. 'Never, never. Really I do not mean to ask her. I choose to do it, thank you, and I will speak to the servant myself.' Still, her desire to take care of the girl is a fine, natural trait of character. A curacy in England I am resolved to get, away from all temptation. 'Moreâ"more,' she murmured. 'Do you trust wholly in Him?' 'Not all, you have friends around you.' 'I'm sure, Rowland, Miss Gwynne needn't do it if she didn't choose. 'I'm no more unchristian than other people, but you're always finding fault with me.' 'Not I, indeed. But what'll we do without mother? 'I shall do very well, I daresay,' said the aunt, whose countenance wore a somewhat austere expression. Oh, if I can only get it, I shall be quite happy. A curacy in London, father! Oh, aunt, how can I thank you enough?' 'What do you think, uncle?' Oh, capital! asked Netta, interposing, for once in her life, at the right time. Come you, sir, go and turn that vagabond out directly, or I'll do it before your mother comes home, hark'ee, sir.' 'I can't father, really.' 'In Mr Owen's room, sir.' 'Hush, Mr Prothero,' she whispered, 'she is asleep. Look here; gently, very gently.' 'No offence, Miss Gwynne? 'Yes, yes, Rowland. What, name o' goodness, have you to do with Miss Gwynne? Now, mother, we must have a search for the money.' It will make a gentleman of you.' I should have Plutus at the head of the imps of darkness about my bed, instead of "Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John," that I used to pray to "bless the bed that I lie on."' 'I'll go down and sit by the fire. Lie you down here. I should like to humble some of our Welsh aristocrats by showing them how the son of Griffey Jenkins can eclipse their genealogies, by the magic power of the Golden God. Still, at the dinner in question, all the elements were not quite well amalgamated. One saw the bulwark in Mrs. Rice Rice's ample, immoveable figure, and in the glance of the eyes that looked over the somewhat mountainous cheek; one saw it in a certain extension of the chin, turn of the mouth, and slightly retroussÃ© nose. One saw it, above all, in her manner to the Protheros. 'She asked to see me yesterday, and I went to her. 'Not at all. And it certainly is very unfortunate. 'I do not know what you mean,' said Miss Gwynne. 'I do not imagine many young ladies will purchase tickets in that lottery,' she said, with a stress upon the 'young ladies.' 'Iâ"Iâ"really, it is scarcely fair to appeal to me, as he is a relation.' 'If I may be allowed an opinion,' said Mrs Jonathan decidedly, also glancing at poor Netta, 'I should say that Howel Jenkins was a complete scapegrace. 'Pon my soul, that's a pretty girl, that little Prothero!' 'How can any one like chess?' 'Chess is a game of great antiquity,' said the Rev. 'Good, good, 'pon my soul!' 'I should certainly like to finish it, but perhaps we are inconveniencing others.' 'Ah, yes, to be sure. He gained high honours at Oxford, and my cousin. 'Do you know that young Prothero is a very handsome young man?' For a momentâ"only for a momentâ"she thought she would return, and strive to atone for the falsehood, by giving up the object of her evening wandering. Again, for a moment, a serious comparison arose in her mind, and she wondered whether her life might be like that of the flowers she had cast away from her? 'Oh, yes; my mother is pretty well. 'You remember the day, dear Netta. Then you do not hate me, although they have done their best to make you do so, by calling me gambler, spendthrift, drunkard, and all the charming etceteras.' 'How well you look, Netta. I should like to see you in a ball-room. 'Oh, yes, of all things in the world.' 'Oh, cousin!' 'No, cousin.' 'How can you? But I can settle all particulars at the proper time, provided only you promise. 'I do not knowâ"I cannot tell whether it would be right.' I am afraid of father, and could not bear to annoy mother, butâ"' 'But you love me better still, Netta; so do not cry, and we will be as happy as the day is long. 'You are a good, kind, little cousin, Netta; but what can you mean about Sir Hugh?' 'But he is desperately in love with Miss Gwynne, or her fortune; so you need not alarm yourself, my little cousin.' You are enough to frighten one out of one's wits.' But come, this is absurd. he asked abruptly. 'But I will not waste time with a canting, Methodist parson like you. 'Why should I care for Netta, who could marry any one I like?' were his thoughts. I should like to out-Herod that puppy Rowland, and make a saint of myself out of a sinner. You have no feeling for any one. Just as his father is dead, and he meaning to be good, and only wishing to see me before he goes to London, and having plenty of money to do what he likes, and intending to pay his debts with it, andâ"- andâ"' Here sobs and tears came to the rescue of the voluble words that would soon have worn themselves outâ"for Netta had no great flow of language. and if they married they would not be happy, he was sure. 'I do not know enough of him, sir, to have any communication of the kind with him,' said Mrs Jonathan, stiffly. mother, you're aâ"I beg your pardon, but when Howel's study, I'll turn to smoking cigars. Why, the very night of his father's funeral he was half drunk, instead of being decent for once.' 'Do you remember when we were lads together, and used to go up to Garn Goch looking for treasures? Mother, go and bring Netta here, and let us see what she has to say for herself.' Why don't you go, and not stand looking as if you was as much by the head as brother Jo.' 'Stay you, sir. You would do better to talk quietly to her.' 'Now, I say, Miss Netta,' there was a pause for a few minutes. 'Do you hear, miss?' 'Yes, father, I hear very well,' said Netta, and muttered to herself in continuation, 'who could help it?' No reply. 'You don't think he's a scamp. Then you mean to have him, I suppose?' 'I didn't say that, father. But I don't see why I may not speak to my own cousin.' Like her father, she could talk better before numbers. 'Do you mean to promise, miss?' Mr Prothero relaxed his hold. Mr Prothero gave Netta a slight shake, which shook more passion into both of them, and frightened Mrs Prothero. 'I won't promise anything at all,' replied Netta doggedly; and freeing herself from her father, she ran to her uncle as if for protection. 'You are all as obstinate as mules,' said Mr Prothero; 'I can't think who you turn after. It must not be augured from his devotion to antiquarian lore that he made a bad clergyman On the contrary, he was always ready at the call of the poorest parishioner, regular in his visits to the sick, charitable in no mean degree, and humble in his deportment to rich and poor. All the villagers knew his strong-and-weak point, and he rarely appeared amongst them without having various stones and imaginary curiosities presented to him, particularly by the young people. was the usual question, the philosophic reply to which would have been, that theirs was actually one of the 'Matches made in heaven.' Mr Prothero inquired anxiously of his wife, when he had cooled a little, whether he had really hurt Netta when he took hold of her arm; to which Mrs Prothero replied with unusual severity, 'No, perhaps it had been better if you had; she wanted some trial or punishment to bring down her proud spirit.' Indeed, the Welsh peculiarities of expression and accent sometimes appeared, so that it would have been difficult to say where she was born or brought up. 'My mother was a Welshwoman, born in some part of South Wales; she was the daughter of a clergyman, and respectably brought up. I remember my father's death, and all our trouble, as if it was yesterday. 'She set up a little school, and for some years did pretty well. if it were not wicked, I should wish myself with my mother, brothers, and sister in heaven.' 'Only one word more, my ladies, and I have done. asked Mrs Prothero. To-morrow I think I may go on my way. 'You are not to go away to-morrow; but I daresay in a few days you will be able to do so, and we can help you a little. 'That I assuredly shall, papa,' was the reply, 'for dear Miss Hall is coming to-day, and that princess of bores, Miss Nugent, has invited herself to tea. 'No; I am thankful to say she is gone to spend a few days with the Llanfawr family.' I should break down at the first word; we never were very familiar. For a minute there was silence, when Miss Hall, recovering herself, said,â" 'Dear Freda, this is all so kind of you. asked Mr Gwynne. asked Miss Hall. 'Very. asked Freda, with a wicked laugh in the corner of her eye. she asked aloud, with a degree of interest. asked Freda. 'Do you call his beaux yeux? No; guess again.' 'Young Rithe Rithe?' 'I do not know any one elthe, exthept that Mr Howel Jenkinth, who, they thay, will be quite a grand man.' 'I do not even know him. You are greatly mistaken, he has been in excellent society, and is going at once to a London livingâ"curacy I mean, but it is all the same.' 'Oh yeth, very. 'I should wish to labour wherever there is the largest field to work in, Miss Nugent, whether in the city or St James's.' 'Oh, papa! He did not, we grieve to say, bestow a similar pastoral thought on Miss Nugent. Excuse me, but I could not take such an unfair advantage,' said Mr Gwynne. was the reply. 'How do you feel, general, defeated?' asked Freda. 'Do you sing, Mr Prothero?' asked Miss Hall; 'all the Welsh are so musical that I think there are few who have not voices.' All the Protheros were musical, and Rowland had a very fine clear voice. 'If I mightâ"' Gladys began and paused. 'Pray, go on, do not be afraid to ask.' 'If I might only make up that cap for you, ma'am, I should be so proud. I used to make caps at home.' asked Netta, forgetful of infection when her personal interest was involved. 'Oh, thank you, miss! The girl was not really hard-hearted, so she changed the subject. Mr Prothero was reading the newspaper at a small round table, with an especial candle to himself. 'Pretty working sure enough. 'Who's there?' He seized a stick and went into the passage, followed by his wife, murmuring, 'Oh, David, bach,' and by Netta as far as the door, from which she peeped down the passage. 'Who's there?' 'And the masther isn't so hard-hearted as he looks,' he added, shaking the astonished farmer by the hand. didn't I take you all in, that's all!' 'I shouldn't have had that if old Nanny Cwmgwyn hadn't given it to me just now. 'Pon my word it is pleasant to be at home again. 'We must have your adventures to-night, Owen,' cried Netta, as she entered, 'and you must tell us why you came home so very shabby. 'But I must go out and find my wardrobe, and all my valuables, that my hospitable Daddy there caused me to throw down, when he gave me such a warm welcome.' Father, you shall have the first peep. 'Come here, mother; Netta, look here.' 'Hush, Owen,' interrupted Mrs Prothero. 'No, wild goose. Now, let's have the story.' I used to have all the labour of the imagination, for my friend Jack Jenkins had not the gift of eloquence; so we agreed that I should be showman, and he porterâ"a division of work that we thought quite fair. He did not make brilliant progress in his studies, though he was clever enough, and accordingly his aunt persuaded her vicar to adopt her favourite nephew, Rowland, in his stead, and to let Owen go a voyage or two in a merchant vessel, to cure him of his love for a seafaring life. 'I knew you would say so,' exclaimed Netta. 'You are a kind, dear brother. They are all turned against him, even mother, who can take in the scum of the earth, and make much of a wretched Irish beggar, and will not ask Howel here, who is a gentleman,' 'Oh! 'No, I assure you; and I won't forget him, that's more.' Netta. But, perhaps now he is so rich he will not think of you.' Mr Prothero had almost forgotten the Irish beggar, and certainly did not suppose the tidy-looking, pale, tall girl before him to be her. 'I shall have finished it directly, sir.' asked Mr Prothero. The girl bent her head over the coat she held in her hand, and her tears fell upon it. give me my coat. Mother, come you here, I want to speak to you.' Mr Prothero left the room, and Mrs Prothero followed. 'Who's that girl, mother? 'Why, David, you seeâ"it isâ"there now, don't be angry.' Indeed, she does more in a day than most girls in a week Owen wanted some shirts, you seeâ"she made that cap you admired so much, and that new gown of Netta's; and has more than paid forâ"' 'But who the deuce is she?' But are you very angry, David?' 'No, I don't mind her doing a little work in an honest way like that. Mother, you're a good 'ooman, and God bless you!' The girl's strength gradually returned, but with it there appeared to be no return of youth or hope. 'Treue for you there, my girl,' said Mr Prothero, 'but I daresay mother will make believe that she knows something. 'Do you think,' said Mrs Prothero, addressing Gladys, 'that you could manage to help in the harvest; My husband says he will employ you, if you can.' 'Oh, thank you, my lady! I know a Rev. The girl clasped her hands and looked imploringly at Owen. asked Mr Prothero, as he and his son Owen were standing by the big wheat-mow, awaiting the arrival of a load of corn. 'I'll go and see what he wants,' said Owen, and off he went. He returned, bearing a note for his father. 'Read you it out loud, Owen.' 'You don't see, sir, I daresay you don't. not I: but stop, I'll write. I am really afraid of the consequences.' 'Determined, is she! Why, the girl isn't worth such a bother? 'What did that servant want, Owen?' she asked when she came quite near? He knocked gently, but received no answer. One, two, three, and, now, open the door, I'm going. One, two, three, and away!' 'You are all unfeeling, unnatural, cruel, selfish, hard-hearted heathens! You don't care for me or Howel any more than as if we were strangers. he do say you will have a horse, too. why, tak' your time and you'll be seeing how study and pretty he do behave. Ah, Mrs Prothero! you was being very good to us when I was losing my poor Griffey. Mr Prothero put on a smart coat, brushed his hair, and came into the parlour, as became one about to meet a grand lady. Mr Prothero was as much struck with the improvement in the widow's appearance as his son. 'Why, I declare, cousin 'Lizabeth, you look ten years younger than you did when I saw you last. My poor Griffey.' She's too young, and Howel isn't the lad to study her.' 'Let him marry 'em all, I don't want him.' 'Never you mind, Netta, fach,' were the last words, 'Howels don't be meaning to give you up.' 'Oh dear, dear! But no. forgive me! asks Netta hastily. Why didn't he come here himself? 'Come you, Netta, fach! Come you!' She bursts out crying, and stamps her foot as she exclaims,â" 'Does he think he's going to do what he likes with me because he's rich? 'Come you, Netta, fach! 'See you, Netta, it isn't six yet.' 'Five-and-twenty minutes to six, see you.' If he should see me,' says Netta. 'Do make haste, Aunt 'Lisbeth.' They walk on for about a quarter of a mile, when carriage wheels are distinctly heard, and in a few moments a fly and pair is distinctly seen coming at great speed. I was going back, and I wish I had,' sobs Netta. She clings close to him, and hides her face on his shoulder and sobs on. He draws her to him, and lets her grief have way. 'Hide you, Howel! hide you, Netta! They are just in time for the express, and soon find themselves seated in a first-class carriage. 'Deet, and this is like a sofa in a drawing-room. 'The best thing you can do, mother. You are become so grand.' 'Never mindâ"white paper with two meanings. They are very great friends of mine; very grand people.' Well, I have ordered the wedding-breakfast, carriages, everything. You don't know half my talents yet.' you was telling me of her. I'll be staying after you, Howel, bach. As to his mother, knowing her peculiar tastes, he gave her a glass of brandy and water, upon plea of illness, which she took with evident pleasure; but fearing to attract the attention of the smart people around her, sipped so daintly, that it was not half finished when the signal to return to the carriages sounded, and Howel hurried her off. 'Now, what do you think of it, Netta?' One after another. 'Piccadilly, mother. 'Deet, and I should think so. Well, I do be calling them handsome men. William, take them up.' 'Treue for you there!' 'This must be the first and last time mother,' he said, as he did so. The girl cannot quite forget the friends she left behind her, when she so suddenly ran away from home. 'Do I look as if I had been crying, aunt?' asks Netta, wetting her eyes with lavender water. Netta. 'Good morning, Mrs Jenkins, your son has chosen a bewitching young person indeed!' 'Treue for your ladyship,' says Mrs Jenkins, making her very best curtsey, as the ladies alternately shake hands with her. 'Of course, my dear, papa will take you to the hymeneal altar, and our friend Captain Dancy will take me.' 'You are a great lady now, Netta. We must astonish the little people down in Wales. Ours, Netta dear.' I should like to assist in showing you some of the lions, Mrs Howel Jenkins,' 'Lions! The carriage was at the door, and the luggage in. 'Stop you, Howel, bach! in a minute. We must be wishing you joy at home; and I should like to be sending cousin Prothero some of this grand cake.' 'We mustn't waste money, mother.' 'Treue for you, Howel.' We must now leave Netta and her husband for a time, and return to the morning when Netta left her home to go forth in search of a new one. Say grace, mother, if you please.' 'Eggs and bacon. asked Mr Prothero. 'Oh, David! Mr Prothero and Owen appeared. 'How can you read now, you unnatural son?' 'Oh, father! father, Netta!' 'Never mind her; think of your mother, ten thousand times as precious.' 'Oh, Netta! was all she could say, when they asked her what was the matter. 'Never mind her, mother, but get better,' said Mr Prothero, his usually rosy face almost as pale as his wife's. Mr Prothero looked at the girl, and saw her eyes full of tears, but her face was calm and pale, and seemed to indicate a self-possession that no one else present had. she sobbed. Take comfort, ma'am, it may not be so very bad.' No, not if she were stopping a mile off instead of whirling away in her grand coach and four nobody knows where. Mr Prothero returned to his wife before his passion was calmed. dear, dear husband! but for my sake, for yours, for all, for God's sake, see to this, or I shall die.' Mr Prothero was cowed at once by this passionate burst of grief. she sobbed, when she had controlled her great emotion. I know she is proud and wilful, and obstinate; but oh! No, David, bach! 'Stop you, mother, stop you! They are off to London to be married, and 'tis no good to try to look for 'em there.' 'No, Davy, I can't lie in bed, I must go and look for Netta.' 'Now, wife, I 'ont have none of this nonsense. Mr Prothero left the room, and his wife insisted upon getting up. 'Pray for me, Gladys, I cannot think or pray for myself, I am so bewildered.' As to his not marrying her after all, that is absurd. I know Howel better than you do, or anybody else, except Rowland. 'Why, I should do the very same thing to-morrow. She's father all over. if she isn't a quiet one. You are not fit to see all the people who are already on their way to condole or congratulate. You will have half the parish here before night; I passed old Nancy, Cwmriddle, hobbling down the lane, and she will be here shortly.' Mr Prothero came into the yard at the same time. 'All that ungrateful, good-for-nothing daughter of ours, Miss Gwynne. I know you are a true lady and a kind friend, miss, and have more sense than all the rest of the country put together, so I don't mind telling you what I think. Dining with bishops and rectors, and as fine as my lord. 'Sir, the mistress is very ill. 'Never had a doctor in my house since Netta was born, that's the trouble she brought with her; I'd as soon have an undertaker. Excuse me, Miss Gwynne, whilst I go and see what's the matter.' 'Not at all; papa always stands up for Lady Nugent and her insipid daughter. 'You are quite mistaken, he has always admired you very much, only you are so dreadfully reserved with him. 'You are so impetuous, Freda; I am sure your papa has never thought of it.' 'Not exactly in a downright way, nor will he till Lady Nugent makes the proposal; then he will be rather frightened at first, and finally think that she will head his table more gracefully than I shall, and be less dictatorialâ"and I shall go into a convent.' It must be true love with me, or none at all. 'You do not remember me! I am so glad to see you!' 'How do you do, Mr Gwynne? 'I only came down last night, and this is the first place I have visited.' 'And this was what the bells were ringing for last night?' Does he read your mind at a glance? He is, in short, a man of the world. The young heir was wise enough to retain his post as officer in Her Majesty's service, though not to sequester all his income for the payment of his father's, grandfather's, and great-grandfather's debts or mortgages. I remember the father, but the son was some years my junior. 'But he has money, and as far as negotiations have gone, seems willing to pay, so I am content.' 'Oh, papa!' Mr Prothero stormed and lamented by turns. if it is mine, burn it unread.' 'Do as you will, but don't let me see it. 'Cards, by jingo!' 'Oh, Mr Owen, just let me cut round the neat little seal. 'All right, mother. Netta is married at any rate,' cried Owen. 'But not a lineâ"not a word from Netta!' Why did she leave me never to see me again?' Ha, ha, ha! D. Prothero, Esq. Oh, I shall die of it! Now, really, father, you ought to be proud.' He seized the paper with an oath, crumpled it up, and thrust it into the fire, and gave Owen such a violent blow on the back with his fist, that the young man's first impulse was to start up and clench his in return; however, his flush of passion cooled in a moment, and he said,â" 'Come, father! remember it isn't I that ran away. asked Mrs Jenkins in a grand tone of voice. 'Ever since Miss Netta left, ma'am.' 'They are out harvesting, ma'am.' She felt sure that Mr Prothero would not admit Mrs Jenkins under his roof, and that her mistress would be afraid to do so; however, she ventured to ask her to come in and wait a little time whilst she sent for Mr Owen. I can tell you you've pretty well dirtied that white petticoat.' 'What did you expect, 'Lizabeth Jenkins? 'She's more likely to be here in satins and velvets, cousin,' said Mrs Jenkins, rising from her seat, and walking up and down, apparently in great wrath. 'Did she cry, cousin? asked Mrs Prothero, sitting up in bed, and looking at Mrs Jenkins with a quick, wild eye, quite unlike her usual quiet glance. Is seureâ"she did cry enough, if that's a pleasure to you. 'asked Mrs Prothero, through her sobs. 'Yes, indeet! he!' Good morning.' Just as Mrs Jenkins was making a kind of curtsey by the bedside Gladys said that she saw Mr Prothero riding up to the house. Forgive me if I have been rude? Not so Gladys, however. To her the doctor gave his directions, to her Mr Prothero turned for information, to her Owen came for comfort; and even Mrs Jonathan, who had scarcely ever spoken to her before, looked to her as the only hope in this time of uncertainty. 'Pray for her, Mr Owen, pray for her. Oh, God! All the talk of the farm-servants was upon subjects ominous of death. 'She's the death of her mother I always say.' 'And they do say that the Irish girl is better than a daughter to 'em all.' if he do come, perhaps he may rouse her up a bit.' he asked of Dr Richards. 'Yes, but you had better let your father know you are come; he is in the outer room.' He bent down and kissed the cold forehead of his mother, then turned away, covered his face with his hands, and wept silently. 'Pray for your mother, Rowland,' was all he could say. Mr Prothero seemed calmer after he rose from his knees, and ventured to lean over his wife to assure himself that she still breathed. They stood round her bed watching the calm, pale face with a love and anxiety so intense that they could neither speak nor breathe. All the anxious faces of the household flitted before her when she tried to compose herself. She prayed for them, for all. Now that he really was a man of education and a gentleman, in spite of all her kindness to his mother, she knew it full well. Why did he never consider what any one else in his own neighbourhood thought of him or his family? Mr Prothero took her place. She felt the tear, heard the kind words, and seemed to understand the vow, for she looked at him tenderly, and said in her low, weak voice, 'God bless you, David!' All the children and their teachers were assembled here, and a great many of their relations, also most of the farmers and their families. It must be acknowledged that she not unfrequently distracted the attention of many a young man from his hymn-book on Sunday, when at church; and on the present occasion, what with the face and the voice, more than one pair of eyes were fixed on her. You have reason to be proud of him. Mr Prothero and his son Owen headed the tenantry, and carried between them a magnificent banner, fashioned at the farm, bearing as motto, 'Prosperity to Glanyravon.' asked Freda, rather peremptorily, for she disliked that the Nugents should carry off the all-fascinating colonel. They stood awhile, looking on, and talking over the day. 'I should never have managed the children so well, and I must say, much as I like your uncle, I don't think he would have managed the services so well as you have done.' If so, you will not wonder at the end of this chapter. For a moment she was abashed at the gaze, and coloured deeply, whilst her eye-lids drooped over the eyes he sought. For a moment she stood as if hesitating what to say, then, suddenly drawing herself up to her full height, she looked haughtily at him, and said words that he never forgot to his dying day. Yes, I will go directly. 'Yes, father. 'You are ill, Rowland?' 'No, only tired. Yes, great. It should be upon pride, and should touch her as well as himself. Owen, too, had been ruminating upon the nature of woman, and was not in a very good humour; he, however, had been cheerfully talking to his mother of the events of the day, and duly lauding their own particular hero, Rowland. 'Do you mean what you say?' 'Bravo, Rowland; now I must put the application to your lecture. So, now, cheer up, old boy! He did not read them over, but promised to do so on the morrow, which was Saturday. You would not have me marry him, would you?' 'Certainly not, for many reasons. Then it was wrong of me to be friendly, and right of him to make a dunce of himself.' 'But I don't believe in the heart, you see, Serena. No, you are quite out of your depth now, Serena. 'Oh, Serena! I know that I used to take an unkind delight in teasing him, and that he was rather clever in repartee, and never spared me in return. 'I shall never forget the pained and melancholy expression of his features when I did so, or the few words he uttered. He did not join the family that evening, and the next day I left the Merryweathers. 'I do not know how it was, but when I returned home, I thought more of this young man than of any one else. All the happiness I have knownâ"at least the greatestâ"since our troubles, has been in this house. I had, of course, told her of his proposal and my refusal. 'But he is not married, Serena, I know he is not married,' she exclaimed. 'Oh, Serena! Dear me, who wath he, Freda?' 'Longfellow, you mean, I suppose.' 'Of courth. Thould you, Mith Hall?' 'But not probable,' whispered Freda. 'How can she tell that?' asked Freda, with feigned surprise. 'How can I thank you sufficiently? The colonel opened a sketch-book that he had in his hand, and put it into Freda's. 'Why, this is Gladys, Mrs Prothero's Gladys. 'Do you admire her, Colonel Vaughan? 'And thuch a beautiful voice!' asked the vicar. We must answer the question by informing the reader that, having watched his congregation leave the church, he went into the vestry and sat down there, in order to avoid meeting any of the Gwynne party; when a messenger from his aunt came to inform him that he was wanted at once. 'We must have some more chess. She, so exclusive! suggested Miss Nugent. I should be very glad to introduce you to some, if you would come and see me in town.' 'That I certainly will,' said the colonel, heartily; 'and I shall be able to tell you all about your sister, as I heard yesterday that her husband has finally taken my place, and will be down here as soon as it is put in first-rate order, furnished, etc.' 'You are not likely to leave us yet I hope, Colonel Vaughan?' 'In these days the enlightened must not hide their light under a bushel. 'Good must conquer eventually,' said Rowland, 'and is conquering daily and hourly.' 'We hope so. 'Freda, I think we must go.' 'Let me carry that bucket for you, Gladys,' said Owen, one evening when she was proceeding across the farm-yard, to carry a warm mesh to a sick cow. 'Oh, sir! she is but a poor, sick, witless animal.' 'But she has you to nurse and be kind to her; so I wish I were that cow.' Come, poor Mally. Drink it up.' 'Never mind, Mally, but attend to me. You will drive me off to sea again, ma'am, if you don't take care. Look into my face, and say why you hate me so!' Mr Owen! you are too kindâ"too kind; but do not talk to me so, or it will break my heart.' 'Oh,' sir! I do, sir, I do. I do, sirâ"I do. I thank you, I pray for you, I love you all, always; indeed, indeed, I do.' 'But I must, I will, and you must listen. Mr Owen, if your parents were to hear you talking like this to me, what would they say to you? Anything else, but not this! and from you.' 'I do not mean to forget it, Gladys, or to let you forget it. 'I shall not please to do anything of the kind, for I only stayed so long on your account, and this is the reward I get.' For a moment he had hope, and pressed the hand he held. he asked. no sir,' said Gladys, sadly. 'How can you suspect me of such a thing? 'One more, Gladys. Those beneath you, then. no, sir, I do not think so; no one says so to me, and I care for none of them. 'I should think she 'ould, seure enough,' said a stentorian voice, as Mr Prothero entered the cow-house, having just heard the last words, and seen the clasped hands. Where Gladys is, you're seure to be pretty near. 'But I don't cheuse her to be thinking you're going to make love to her, and by-and-by, perhaps, expecting toâ"there's no knowing what young 'oomen may expect.' 'Treue for you there; but that's no fault of yours. You don't take notice of any other female that I see, and seure you eused to make love to them all in turns.' 'But she's Welsh, father, and you said so yourself.' 'She's a mongrel, and no good ever came out of them.' 'Treue for you again there. mother, mother, if you were here to comfort your poor child! She felt that they were talking about her. Good night, mother dear.' And so she fell upon her knees, and prayed for blessings on every member of that family; she forgot no one, not even poor Owen, whose suit she had rejected. 'Back, good dog! Home, Lion!' Very sadly she took up the pretty cap that was left there, and looked at the large piece of netting to which was appended a paper. But what do you mean?' 'Indeed, I don't know, Davy bach!' Mr Prothero took out his glasses, wiped them deliberately, and put them on, whilst his wife stood before him rubbing her poor little hands as usual. If I am too bold, forgive me, but my heart is full. I can only thank you for all you have done for me, by my prayers! You will be rewarded in this world for your care of the poor orphan, who prays to meet you in the next.â"GLADYS.' Mr Prothero began to stamp with rage. upon 'em both. 'Davy, bach! 'Shall I lay breakfast, ma'am?' 'I'll go out and see whether either of the horses is gone. 'Treue for you! Well, what did the young scamp say? All the horses were safe. asked Mrs Prothero timidly. No, not I. But it's all your fault. The young hussy.' Mr Prothero was resolved to take no notice of her tears, but hastily swallowed his breakfast and went out. 'Shall I send and tell him you want to speak to him?' Mr Prothero was soon in the house again, at Miss Gwynne's bidding. 'Indeed, Mr Prothero,' said Miss Hall, 'I think you may trust Gladys; that letter is sincere if ever anything was.' 'Who is to search, for there is no time to lose?' asked Miss Gwynne. I shouldn't like people to fancy we were in a fuss and fright. But go at once, and thank you very much.' 'I'll go Swansea way, for I am sure they'll take to the sea. 'Was the man like my son Owen?' asked the farmer. 'Young couple, my lord?' asked the woman. Mr Prothero nodded assent. Young man something like you, and handsome.' 'An hour ago.' Mr Prothero rode quickly down the lane, along the turnpike, up the first turning to the right, and then up a long and tedious hill. It will be unnecessary to describe how Mr Prothero wandered over this hill for hours, without finding those he sought. Mr Prothero had to swallow a very broad expression of disgust, as well as to listen politely to that young lady, who persisted in saying she would continue the search for Gladys if he would not. I'll give her one more turn, and then have done with her. Mother, if I don't come home to-night, don't be frightened, as she may have gone a good step.' Mr Prothero was leaving the room, when Miss Hall stopped him, saying,â" 'I thought, Mr Prothero, that you might not have seen this notice of a meeting in your son's parish, and as he is mentioned, I brought over the paper for you.' Mr Prothero thanked Miss Hall, and took out his spectacles. 'And the Bishop of London was in the chair. Mr Prothero started as soon as his horse was ready, and, it must be confessed, in a very bad temper. Good morning, Mr Prothero.' he asked. was the rejoinder. 'Was there a young man with the girl?' Mr Prothero rode on to the picturesque village bearing this name. 'Good morning, Mrs Lewis.' 'Walk in, Mr Prothero. 'Good morning, Mrs Lewis, thank you. Mr Prothero found it easiest to ask for the girl with a large black dog, and traced them to within a mile of Carmarthen. Is seure. Mr Prothero paid handsomely for his ale, and having learnt that Gladys and Lion went straight to Carmarthen, went thither also. The afternoon was far advanced, still he rode on. All the little boys on the way had noticed the big dog, and could point out the route he and Gladys had pursued. down, good dog, down! Don't upset me, Lion, bach. Mr Prothero was off his horse, and Lion was over the hedge in a moment. Oh, sir! forgive me.' 'Come you, Lion, good dog! And so they all went, as fast as they could, to the neighbouring village. Mr Prothero, with no small noise and bluster, knocked up the inmates of the little inn of that little place, and succeeded in getting Gladys ensconced by a cheerful fire in the kitchen. Mr Prothero kept out of her way lest he should say something that he might afterwards repent of in the warmth of his delight at finding her again. Mr Prothero told the landlady to leave Gladys in bed the next morning until nine o'clock, by which hour he supposed she would be sufficiently refreshed, and then retired himself, feeling thankful to Miss Gwynne for having made him do a good action, but still believing that Owen must have been in the secret of Gladys' sudden flight. She felt very stiff and weak, and her hands trembled so much that she could scarcely dress herself. Mr Prothero was waiting for her in the little parlour of the inn. Mr Prothero began at once. It must be remarked, however, that he had previously learnt from the landlady that Gladys was pretty well, and had eaten a good breakfast. 'Oh, sir, I am very thankful to ye and to them. I know I don't deserve such kindness.' 'Treue for you there. I should have thought you'd have known that one 'lopement was quite enough from one house. 'I, sir? 'Indeedâ"indeed, I don't know, sir. 'But he isn't at home. 'Oh, not with me, sirâ"not with me, I assure you. Mr Prothero looked at the agitated girl, and felt inclined to believe her. 'What did he say to you? 'I can't be much more angry with him than I am, but tell you the treuth. 'That I couldn't marry any one in this world, sir.' 'What do you mean to wait for, then?' But what made him go away?' 'No, sir.' 'Ha, ha! He's a fine young man, however.' 'No, sir, I don't think I shall ever marry him. As far as I can see now, I am sure I never shall.' You don't mean to marry him, and yet you 'ont promiseâ"what do you mean?' 'I scarcely know myself, sir. But I cannot tell what God may appoint for me in the future, and so I cannot make a solemn promise.' 'No, sir, never.' 'Why, "no, sir," if you 'ont promise?' What's the difference?' Mr Owen has been like a brother to me, and the mistress like a motherâ"and youâ"oh, sir! Mr Prothero was touched; he could ask no more questions. 'No, sir.' 'No, sir.' 'You don't want to leave Glanyravon parish?' 'No, sir. And I do not wish or mean ever to marry any one, if you will only believe me.' Now, go you and get ready.' they'll be the death 'o me, one way and another. He did not talk much to her, but contented himself with making her eat and drink a great deal more than was pleasant for her, because, as he phrased it, 'People shouldn't think she was starved at Glanyravon.' Come along, old girl! Lion, old boy! 'By no means. 'No, sir; but I shall be glad to offer a bed to any friend of Mr Gwynne's, though I am sure you'll find one at the Park.' 'You are very kind. 'You're not Welsh, sir, I should say?' 'A clergyman, sir?' 'I do not know him personally, but I know him by reputation; he is curate of an old friend of mine, Mr Stephenson.' Allow me to shake hands with you, sir. 'Certainly, if I shall not inconvenience you and your family. 'No, sir, thank you; I am only rather tired,' was the reply. I should think so! 'I shall not see him probably. Come in, Gladys, fach! Mr Prothero, how do you do? I am so glad you have brought us back Gladys. 'Do you still stand to your text, Miss Gwynne?' It will be a great thing for the girl.' 'I would much rather go to Miss Gwynne in any capacity, and if I can be of useâ"it is best, my dear mistress.' 'Glad, papa? We must not belie our country. Do write, papa. 'But I don't hope it, my dear.' you are a capital pater, and I will send this off immediately. 'That I can safely do,' said Mr Jones. Now that he found himself in his own country again, he felt far behind most men in worldly conversation though very far beyond them, not only in religious, but in practical, useful, and general knowledge; such knowledge, I mean, as would be suited to the improvement, not merely of savages, but of the wild, lawless bushmen, gold diggers, and convicts of the Australian world. He would have found abundance to love and respect in the man who left the luxury, science, learning and refinement of England, in that most wonderful of all ages, to labour amongst the refuse of her people in the largest of her colonies. she asked again. 'Certainly,' was the reply. asked Miss Hall, casting an entreating glance upon Freda, who, however, would not see it. It will take me five minutes to run down the hill, five minutes to say my say, and five to get to the waterfall. Come, Frisk, come with me.' 'didn't I, Frisk? 'I should like to make up a match, it would be such fun. But what should I do without her? But I don't mean to break my heart,â"do I, Frisk?' The 'do I, Frisk?' And, indeed, we want him sadly, Miss Gwynne. 'I do indeed, Miss Gwynne. 'Not at all. 'You are so very kind, Miss Gwynne, I do not know what we should have done without you. were his queries. 'No, not at all; besides, he is a middle-aged man.' And so it proved; during that long walk the old love had become new, and two people as deserving of happiness as most of the poor sinful mortals who are for ever seeking her, were made perfectly happy for that day at least. But so it was to be. 'Shall we call?' Money, as I have somewhat commonplacedly remarked elsewhere, is the master-key to most hearts, and Howel found that nearly all the hearts in his native county were opened by his wealth. cried Howel, hastening up to him with great good will. 'A queer road to take; but you come to see us on your way, of course. My cousin, Mr Simpson, my wife's brother. He reached the house, and rang stoutly at the bell. said he, as he found his way into the breakfast-room. you are, about the eyes. 'What do you think of her, Owen?' 'I can't exactly say,' was the reply; 'but she is no longer Netta Prothero of the Farm.' 'I should imagine not!' 'Not even of the old place where we used to steal lollilops?' every minute.' of Plas Abertewey, and his friends. He did so, accordingly, and with that spirit of liberality which characterised him when any popularity was to be acquired thereby purchased a great number of tickets, and distributed them amongst his servants and neighbours with majestic grace. Duvet, who was constant in her admiration of him. Owen spied her at once, and took Mme. 'I didn't be going to Abertewey since you was coming there, ma'am,' said Mrs Griffey, rising and curtseying, to the unspeakable diversion of Mrs Rice Rice and Mr Deep. treue for you there. Oh, Mrs Rice Rice, fach! Ma'am, I was disappointed! What, sir! Not so bad that for Wales, Mrs Rice Rice. look you at him. He, he, he, sir! You don't be hearing anything like that in England. my 'deet, I am sorry. He did not venture to speak to her, but nodding to one and another as he passed, said, 'I shall be back directly. asked the servant. 'You did nothing but flirt and giggle with him all the evening. holding it up and shaking it, 'it is very nearly empty.' 'I should be only too happy if I could bring anything to the bank, said Owen; 'but I am too proud to be a penniless partner.' 'I wouldn't mind lending you a trifle on them.' She don't care for me. All but Gladys, who won't even look at it, or me. Well, I was never so happy at home before; and I know it isn't right to leave my father and mother; and I have never done any good all my life; and I, the eldest son, and very nearly thirty years of age! Excuse me now, as I must go and see my sister.' 'Oh, yes, many others would if it were necessary; but I wanted to have you all to myself. yet.' Only think what my motherâ"' 'Nonsense, Owen. 'You are right, Netta, but I hope to mend. 'And marry Madame Duvet? 'They all do it in Paris, Owen, and what's the harm? Well, indeed! Come, Howel's better than that any day. 'Handsome is that handsome does,' said Owen, getting very red. I at least am thankful that I still have a mother, and I owe it to her.' you needn't be in such a huff directly, Owen. They are very old friends, Howel says, and have known one another for years; he is a very fashionable man, an attorney by profession. 'I should think not,' said Owen, smiling; 'at all events, Mr Simpson's races would be at a stand still without him. Just as he was in the act of obeying, Howel appeared. not up, Netta? Owen, there's a letter for you. 'Let me see the direction,' said Netta, trying to get the letter from her brother. 'No, no,' said Owen. 'It makes you blush, however,' laughed Howel. Ha, ha! 'My mother tells me that she ran away from Glanyravon, and report says with somebody we know of. The girl is a beauty, certainly, butâ"' 'Hush, Howel!' 'Not exactly, Netta,' said Owen, smothering rising anger, and looking very red; 'but I won't hear a word said against her either by man or woman. Mr Owen, if you would only go back and see your dear mother and honoured father, and learn how lonely they are without you, I think you would give up the sea, or at least remain with them for some time. With best love to mother, I am, your affectionate son,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â OWEN.' 'Probably so,' replied Owen. When are you coming, Jenkins?' 'Only in time for Ascot. Owen, you must come over and see her when I am away.' You will run less risk in taking care of Netta than you will at Ascot.' You will run less risk than at sea.' 'Yes, but not at home, father. 'I'm not seure of that. But I can't promise to give up Netta. I know that I have not been what I ought to have been to you hitherto, and my desire is to make up for the past as well as I can. Now I can do ath I like.' asked Freda, bluntly. 'Let me thee. 'You are tho tirethome, Freda; of courthe there are other thingth, but one cannot think of them all at onthe. 'Indeed! the didn't hear him. 'To your mamma, or you?' 'Do you think there is any one else in the world besides your mamma and yourself?' 'I forgotâ"you are tho quick, Freda. 'Pretty well sometimes.' asked the colonel. 'Oh, yes, I am looking forwards to that, and to the first dance. 'Oh, yeth, I am thure of plenty of partnerth.' 'I should imagine so. 'No, I rode. The hortheth are taken round. 'How does the drawing get on Freda? quite artistic.' 'Very. Now, don't be engaged on Thurthday. The horses were ordered, and the colonel assisted the young heiress to mount. I am afraid you are veryâ"cross,' 'Thank you, Colonel Vaughan. by no means. But I do not wish to assist in any of the Nugent decorations. 'You are severe upon your neighbours, Freda.' 'Do you admire them, then? 'Do you stereotype your compliments? I hear that you pay them wherever you go, and I hate compliments, particularly from people whose good opinion I value. 'You do not suppose that I class you together, Freda?' 'Oh, is that all! Yet she provokes me, interests me. Well, what a fool I am! The horses are ordered, and they are soon trotting down the drive. He is better, I hope?' 'Certainly, sir, if you wish it; I will tell Miss Gwynne, and she will know to whom to give it.' 'By no meansâ"I mean it for you.' 'Sir, you will excuse me, I would rather not,' said Gladys, curtseying again, and hastening on. he asked. 'Almost every day, sir,' was the reply. 'In the afternoon, sir, from three to five, or thereabouts.' 'Who is that girl, Mr Gwynne?' my daughter's maid, I believe. Freda is very fond of her.' They struck into another path, and Colonel Vaughan saw no more of Gladys that day, though he peeped into various stray corners of the house in the hope of doing so. 'Do you know where Colonel Vaughan is, Gladys?' asked Miss Gwynne. If so, I can send some one else with the wine.' She felt independent, and placed in a position where she knew her exact duties. 'No, Mr Owen, you are mistaken.' 'You thrive upon your absence, Gladys. 'How is the dear mistress, Mr Owen? andâ"andâ"' 'Not so fast, Gladys. Come and see. They are all quite well. 'No,' said Gladys, laughing. I was told so.' Why did Gladys blush so very much more than before, and say the 'sir' so stiffly? 'But I am on parole, both to you and my father. just tell me this.' 'Veryâ"very. I can only be happy. 'Not so fast, Gladys. You have avoided me hitherto, both when you were at Prothero's and here, and purposely misunderstood meâ"now you must walk through the wood with me, and at my pace, for I must speak to you.' 'I shall do no such thing; neither will you, I hope?' 'I most certainly shall, if necessary.' 'Never mind; I must know, at all risks, who and what you are.' 'Was the daughter, I believe, of a clergyman.' 'Starvation.' No answer. 'Do you love that rough sailor?' No answer. 'I respect and love her. 'You! 'I love you, Gladys.' 'A villain, you would say. Not at all. They stood face to face, looking at each other. 'I do not insult you, Gladys, I honour and respect you. He seized her hand as he spoke, and held it tight. You will be no longer a servant. You are not one at this moment.' 'Sir, you had now better let me return home. As his nose bled, so did his intellect clear. Bleeding, on the old system, was never more successful. No; a most courtly one. 'Pon my word, I never loved any one so much before. All over my cravat. I vow, I am so giddy I can scarcely walk; and this horrible bleeding won't stop. I vow, it is just six o'clock. Yes, I will dress directly. You are quite right. Surely she is come back.' 'No, ma'am. Can I do anything, ma'am?' 'No, thank you; but send Gladys as soon as she comes. here they are; and here are the flowers and trimmings in a box, in the neatest possible order.' Come in! 'I shall save her,' thinks Gladys, 'if I ruin my own happiness.' The carriage, I suppose. Come in,' says Freda. It must have something to do with Colonel Vaughan. Speak.' I can tell you all I know. her benefactress, her all? You have dreamt it, Gladys. Go!' Again, she knew that a man of his position could only be trifling with a girl in her's, and was ready to hate and despise one who could be so vile. You look so ill, and feel so cold.' It always has this enervating effect on me,' was the answer. I hear you have suffered from it also.' she asked, suddenly joining in the conversation. you, about whom every one is speculating.' 'Freda, my dear, I am so glad you are able to speak. I hope, Colonel Vaughan, you also have got over your weakness. 'I said nothing but the truth, ma'am, but perhaps offended you in saying it to you, merely to excuse myself. 'No, ma'am, I certainly did not.' He did not talk, because conversation was forbidden during these attacks, but there was an increased briskness in his eyes and step as he approached her, and, she fancied, more of anxious care in his tone when he spoke. 'Not at present,' he said. 'No, I shall be better directly. Only the exertionâ"yes, you were telling meâ"' Strange that Mr Gwynne never supposed that Freda could be in love with any one. 'What do you mean, papa?' I should not even have told you this had it not escaped me in reply to what you said, because I thought it would annoy you, and perhaps make you feel unkindly towards the Prothero family. 'But, Fredaâ"after allâ"if you do like him. I know all the Perrys by heart. 'Of course not, my dear. 'By no means; the tenants are most prosperous. Say it is not true; only a jest. Your only child. Say it is not trueâ"oh, say it is not true?' He did not understand it. You will make me so nervous. You will be just the same. 'No, no, papa. my child, forgive me! 'Do you consider me a man of honour? 'Certainlyâ"certainlyâ"butâ"' 'Then I wish both you and Lady Mary Nugent to understand that I shall not live here. Not on your account, but on hers. But what is the difference! Forgive me. You will not have me long to speak it, and my successor never spoke her's in her life, so she will not bore you by abruptness and sincerity, as I perhaps have done.' 'Freda, you really do talk too much. Yes, and hate it as much as I shall. No, no; it shall only make me prouder. don't make such a noise. Don't jump so, Frisk. oh, mother!' Come, for God's sake.' 'Of course, ma'amâ"of course.' 'How is she, mother?' were his first words. They was turning me out of Glanyravon.' He bent over her, and kissed her warmly. 'You turned my mother from yours.' 'Not I, Howel; and I have never injured you. Leave me till to-morrow, and I will go.' 'Why not? 'No, no; she says you are very good, and let her have all she wants; but, Howel, riches may not always bring happiness, and we must try to look beyond the perishable things of life for it.' We must now run rapidly through the next six years of Howel and Netta's career. If I lose at the Derby, I must have twenty thousand more.' Alma is pretty safe, I think.' 'Yes, if we can manage to drug Magnificent. 'No; I have tried Levi and Jacobs, and they won't advance any more without better security.' 'No; I ran down to see her the other day, and she had taken offence because she chose to think I had neglected her, and was as obstinate as an old mule. and afterwards we will keep our appointment with Dancy and Lord Dupe; we may make something of the latter, if we can't of the former.' 'You didn't sit up for me, of course?' 'Certainly not; you are not so very agreeable when you come home, as to make me sit up for you.' then you must amuse her, for I certainly won't.' It will be worse for you if you do not. 'With whom, madam?' 'I can't eat anything, I am a great deal too tired and wretched.' 'I shall be able to pay everything next month. But I don't want to be under any obligation to him.' that you hate so now, and treat so unkindly.' 'No, no, Howel! Dear, dear Howel! 'Shall the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots.' asked Netta. 'Yes, Netta, dear, I will. 'No; you must have your breakfast now, and I will make it. I am so happy.' 'No; I hate him.' You was looking as pale as those wox figures at Mrs Tuss's; and seure won was as like you as could be. But such beauty music, and dresses, and all like life. 'Pretty well, Howel. 'So I am, mother, or rather shall be by-and-by. 'Not even for me, mother? If Howel trembled, or if his conscience smote him when he did this dreadful deed, he did not let his mother see it. I am really very much obliged to you.' We must keep her here for a long time, and I must get hold of her letters first and read them to her, and alter them if necessary. 'You are coming to see me, Howel, I am so glad,' said Rowland, as they shook hands. cried Howel, turning pale. It is well it is so seldom, Mr Rowland Prothero.' 'Oh, Howel! My eyes, alas! 'Never mind; only, if anything is said to you about that money by any one, take care what you say in answer. Don't answer at all, indeed, or it may ruin you and me. Money, I fear, there is none, unless my mother has any. Send the servants to bed, and do this when all is quiet. You don't want to ruin me, do you?' To-morrow at ten, remember.' Tak' you care of this, and write you to me. You was very good to me since I was come here.' Still, she thought, Howel is kind, and loves me, so I will not mind what else happens. 'With you, Howel, anywhere, not into Wales for the world.' said her father sternly, as Netta led her out of the room. 'We must not be seen by our friends for a time, dear Netta, because I am liable to be arrested. You are better here than at home, as everything will be seized. You are in Rowland's parish, if the worst should come to the worst; but I don't want him to know anything about me, as it will be all right again by-and-by.' 'You did! 'And I, Howel? I left the room, and have never seen him since. He called after, but I could not speak to him again. 'I shall be obliged to leave Mrs Mills and the little girl for a day or two,' said Howel. Still, we left her and find her Winifred Gwynne. I should be so much obliged to you if you would just look them over for me.' 'Of course, I never had a head for figures, and Mrs. Jones could never get me to do my sums.' I should never have got through them. You have been in some of those dreadful haunts, and they have upset you. 'Yes, what of her? Prothero, I am very sorry for you; for Netta; for all. Still, doubtless, one more bitter drop in the cup of his despair, wherever he might chance to be drinking it. 'Mrs Mills, sir.' 'Her mamma calls her Minette, or some such name, sir.' 'Ever since that morning, sir, she has been in a kind of a dream. not for worldsâ"not for worlds! Oh, sir! I am so glad!' 'The little girl went to an old chiffonier and brought a decanter with wine in it. Notâ"notâ"' muttered Netta, as she strove to rise. If Howel comes back I will go away directly. asked Netta, looking at him with a strange, wandering glance, whilst large tears rolled down her cheeks. 'Yes, dear, and you must come home at once. 'No, not you,â"not you.' Lie still, dear Netta.' You are ill, Netta. Andâ"andâ"my head, just here,â"at the top. 'We must nurse you, Netta. not for the world. 'No dear. 'Do you think he will come to-night?' 'I scarcely think he can, Netta. forâ"' 'Yes, yes! 'No,â"I assure you, no! Make the room as home-like as you can, in short. suggested Miss Gwynne. No, I don't remember her. Yes, I should like to see her once to ask her pardon.' 'Yes. and said, 'You will not leave me.' 'Oh, Miss Gladys,' said the girl, 'why did you?' 'Never mind, Sarah, you get the breakfast things and boiling water, and I will do the rest.' he is come!' 'Mamma, I should like Gladys to have some breakfast with us,' said Minette, 'she must be so hungry. 'Let me put it into your button-hole, it smells so sweet.' And, you know, he is my husband, even if I did run away from home, and I must do as he bids me.' 'Yes, if you will not tell him about Howel. 'By no means. But I hear that admirable young woman, whom I call our Sister of Charity, Miss Gladys, has undertaken to nurse her. It should be into the country. To her native air, if possible.' Good morning. Why did that quick, bright flush spread so suddenly over Gladys' pale face? But I cannot forget what I really was, and am.' 'You are and have been everything to us all, and now all our hopes seem to centre in you. It will be less awkward. Oh, uncle, I love her very much, don't you?' 'If mother were only here, it would be quite home-like.' 'Uncle, what have you done with the geranium?' 'I left it at home, dear.' 'Shall we go to her, mammy dear? 'The Evening Hymn, Gladys. GLANYRAVON FARM, October 9, 18â". He would think the matter over, and decide. Kiss our child for me. She wanted no more information, and asked for none. 'I shall be thankful if she can come here,' he said, 'for poor Prothero is making himself quite ill with anxiety and overwork. she is not strong, she will be laid up.' 'I can't go home without Gladys!' 'Yes, quite sure.' I used to think you cross too, but now you are very good to me. Ask mamma if you may say it, dear.' 'Mamma, may I try to say the hymn now? I know the way, mamma.' 'Let me go, uncle. 'My mother gave it me, sir,' was the reply. he asked, pointing to the words written on the fly-leaf, which were, "Margaret Jones, from her affectionate brother, William Jones." 'The daughter of a clergyman, sir.' For God's sake tell me all, Gladys.' 'And thenâ"and her fatherâ"andâ"and her brother?' sir, I cannot tell that either. 'Oh, sir! asked the child. She felt a strange pain at her heart, turned pale, and stood for a moment unobserved by either, on the threshold, irresolute, when she heard these words from her husband,â" 'It must be so. It could not be true. My poor father doated on my sister, and spoilt her. Not at all like Gladys. 'He bitterly repented this, his only deception. And so she delayed, and delayed; but she wrote at last, and received no answer at all. I know she wrote again from Ireland; but the letter was returned, with a note from some one, saying that her father had been dead some years, and no one knew anything of her brother.' I returned from college to nurse, and bury him. 'You are quite right. 'I only wanted to show my gratitude, as I am, to them all. "Where, mother dear!" I asked. she sobbed. 'I shall be better to-morrow. Not to him, for he never doubtedâ"generous, kind Mr Owen! to all. It must be a dream; but will he care for me still? and after all my coldness. you are but a weak woman after all. You are quite a lady, now you have left off that gown mamma gave you so long ago. 'I shall like to go to Glanyravon and make mamma quite well.' 'Of course Aunt 'Lizbeth has employed Mr Rice Rice and a counsel for that scoundrel, to do what they can when the case is tried. But what of that rascal, Deep?' 'I can't help liking poor Aunt 'Lizbeth; she says she will spend every farthing she has for Howel, and when I tell her to remember her old age and keep her money, all I get is, "What will I do if my Howel is ruined? You are the only stay of our parents at home, and will be poor Netta's last comfort.' 'Oh, brother!' Say, will you?' The guard was at the door, Owen in the carriage. 'Do you know, Netta, that I am thinking of getting married?' You have been getting married or falling in love ever since you were twelve,' said Netta. 'Who is it now?' 'Miss Richards,â"Dr Richards' daughter. asked Minette. 'Oh, Mr Owen!' 'Oh, Mrs Snow!' And so Owen and Gladys were tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. 'Dearly, sir, if you like to have me.' 'I didn't mean that, Mr Owen.' 'Iâ"Iâ"don't know. If it was, somebody else would kiss you, too. Now I have an opportunity, I must ask you a few more questions. 'Oh, Mr Owen!' 'Oh, Mrs Snow! 'Bravo, Gladys! You are a capital girl!' 'How can I help it, Gladys? Mr Owen.' I should have been off to sea again long ago but for you, andâ"' 'And the father and mother, Mr Owen.' You don't love me. 'No.' 'Iâ"Iâ"promisedâ"oh, Mr Owen.' Not to marry, not to loveâ"' 'Your father, Mr Owen. 'Do you mean, Gladys, that you promised never to marry me without my father's consent?' 'Yes.' 'Never to love me without his consent?' 'No.' 'No.' 'I would try, Mr Owen.' 'All these years.' 'Is this Glanyravon, mamma?' No answer. Don't cry so loud, you will frighten her.' Her arms are round his neck, and she strives to rise but cannot. 'Do you forgive me, father?' asks Netta. Come and kiss me, mother.' She faints in the midst of all those dear ones, so kind and loving. May she stay with me, father?' he replies. 'Oh, yes! 'Best now, father, whilst I remember. 'Of course, of course, my dear.' Mr Prothero glances rather uneasily at the very lady-like looking young woman, for whom he is thus humbly petitioned, and in doing so spies Owen close behind her. 'So young, so prettyâ"our only girl! 'Do you think so? why, she looks like a corpse. Mr Prothero spent every spare moment with Netta and his grandchild, who soon forgot that 'grandfather,' as he insisted on her calling him, 'talked loud, and had large, rough hands.' Mr Prothero came in, and took his customary seat at the head of her sofa. said her father, cheerfully. 'Of course I do, my dear. Father, will you take her for my sake?' 'Never again with you, Netta, please God.' I should die, I think I should, so much happier, or go away when I am fetched, so much happier, if I could know she was with you as a daughter. Oh, that I were like her! Oh, father! 'Never, father! 'Thereâ"there; don't you begin to cry, and excite yourself. I'll ask the boy.' 'Now, father! Let him come here.' Mr Prothero went out and called Owen, who came in forthwith He began the subject at once. 'Not exactly, father. 'Treue for you there, boy.' Mr Prothero began to rub his ear; a trick he had when in doubt. 'Indeed, father!' 'Do you want me to swear, sir? Upon my deed, then, you may marry the girl. The girl's a good girl, and I like her well enough. Now, p'r'aps you 'ont go to sea.' Kiss me, Netta! You have done it, I know, and you shall dance at the wedding. Now, I'll go and tell Gladys.' 'All right, Gladys! 'Oh, Mr Owen!' 'Oh, Mrs. Owen,' said he. I needn't ask you. 'Uncle, you have wet me all over,' sighed Minette. 'Never mind. 'You are quite sure you love me, Gladys? I am so glad.' 'I can't love her better, uncle,' was the simple assurance of the little girl. 'The girl's dreaming, like Netta,' from Mr Prothero. 'I knew she was true,' from Mrs Prothero. 'How can this be, Gladys?' all's right now, at any rate.' 'Treue for you there, Owen, my boy. You are to bring her up; she is never to leave you. If Howel comes back, say to him this was my wish. he asked. No. Owen, bach! 'We must see, Aunt 'Lizbeth? poor dear, poor dear.' Oh, if I could be going to him, I 'ouldn't be vexing shocking, as I was now. Come you, Owen, tak you a drop of brandy and water. I do tak it very kind of you to be coming to see me.' 'I said if, mother. Is he with you, mother? Come you!' Would you mind it, father?' 'I shall be very glad to see them married, my dear; the sooner the better. 'No, thank you, I shall not be long,' said Freda mechanically. 'I won't cry! 'Shall I get your dress, miss?' 'I can't dress to-night, I am too tired. 'I won't cry,' again she said, as she kissed him affectionately. 'Now, I'll dive 'ou to Tewey.' don't, sir!' asked the child, suddenly tumbling down before her. 'Why should I sigh,' she said. 'I am happier than when it was my home,â"happier, and, I hope, more useful. Harold made a diversion by bursting into the room to ask for his soldiers. She felt at home again for the first time. Here, again, she was at home. 'By no means,' was Mrs Jonathan's reply. They are a rising family. The colonel was to join them at dinner. Freda always felt reserved with him, and his studied kindness and politeness to her when she had met him occasionally in London, irritated her. 'Handsomer, at any rate. Again, she admired the tact of the mother. 'Complimentary,' said Lady Mary. But I don't mind, becauth I underthtand him now.' Not at all. Indeed, I don't like children, and all ours are so spoilt. Harold is so fond of her,' said Mr Gwynne. 'I ull have some of thatâ"and that,' said Harold. I remember he was somewhere in your neighbourhood,' asked the colonel. 'And mamma nearly,' said Mrs Vaughan. She felt as if it were all a dream. 'My sister,' she said more than once emphatically. Mother, what do you say?' Mr Prothero gave her three very hearty smacks, which resounded through the room, and seemed to say at once, 'I am your father; his wife's embrace was quieter, but more tender. Was that pride? she asked herself afterwards, and the answer was, 'Yes.' 'Why, really, Lady Mary, I didn't think about it. Very satisfactory, you know.' I uthed to be afraid of her, but I am not now, at all. All the people will be so disgusted if she does not, particularly poor Sir Hugh. 'No, thertainly not. here they are! Freda and all. I hear her voithe. 'Lords at home, they are only one of a multitude there. 'Certainly not. I should be very glad to think that she would return and live happily at her natural home, sorry as I should be to lose her.' I should wish to have Freda to read with me again; I assure you I miss her in many ways. You are a true friend, Mrs Jones; thank you.' Serena, you want to get rid of me. 'They are everywhere, my love.' 'But so different. 'The change is in yourself, not in the place.' Serena, this is cruel! Well, I suppose duty and propriety concur in my remaining at Glanyravon Park, discretion being the better part of valour.' And so ended Freda's arithmetic. He is in America, I know. 'Oh, yes! I should find him very soon. I should track his steps like a dog, Gladysâ"like a dog.' I know I was wrong to leave them to marry him; though he loves me, Gladys! Still, it might not be well for you to go to him, if he is hiding for debt. 'But I mean to go, Gladys. You would kill her, if you took her so far.' 'No, I was forgetting them. Was that right, Gladys?' We must forgive, as we hope to be forgiven.' Oh, Gladys!' 'You are happy, my love?' 'You are not going away, Netta! It will make her think of me. asked Netta. Now, mother, I will go to bed.' 'How does my girl feel to-night?' asked Mr Prothero cheerfully. 'Let me watch by her, dear mother.' 'No, Gladys, thank you; not to-night. 'Yes, very shortly.' So very faint it is, that she is not quite sure that she hears it at all. 'My God, it is death!' And it is death. A soul in chains, and a soul set free. Mr Prothero had shaken her by the hand on that sad day, but had not spoken to her. 'How do you know this, Aunt 'Lizbeth?' You will be saving him, Rowland, seure!' "As we have sown, so must we reap," in this world.' You was seure to come, Mr Rowlands?' What's a bishop, uncle? Oh, Grandma Jenkins!' Mr Prothero suppressed a very equivocal question concerning the reason of her again appearing at Glanyravon, and said,â" 'How d'ye do, Mrs Griffey?' Mr Prothero had not cried before since Netta's death, and those were, indeed, precious tears. Just in time. 'This one first, sister-in-law.' He pointed her out to his mother, who at once went to her. oh, anwyl! oh, anwyl!' Poor mamma is gone to heaven, Miss Gwynne.' It will light you home.' Mr Prothero saw them to the door, and watched them up the road. Such, too, is life! 'I shall be very sorry,' she said, simply. He did not at that moment pause to think how closely even our highest duties are entwined with our affections, and thereby lowered to earthâ"but so it is. It must cease, alas! Now that we are about to lose you, perhaps, I may do so. 'Yes. 'Oh, Miss Gwynne! I know that many cynical and sentimental readers will ask if there is no danger of the pair of lovers taking cold on an evening in January, whilst thus mutually discovering the 'eternal passion' in the presence of the 'Erl-king.' Readers, there is no proposal, no acceptance. But I rejoice for your sake, and to know that they appreciate you. She burst into a passion, not of grief, but of rage. and no one to be saying a word to help him. Oh, anwyl! 'Treue, for you, Rowland Prothero. Indeed, divinity was always out of my line.' This, too, he had brought for Howel. Look on me as your friend, your brother.' I did, virtually. 'She forgave you, and called you husband.' oh, God! 'You do! I see. But I did not know how I loved her until I knew how she loved me.' I tried last night, and I could not. 'Netta. He did not spare him. I thank you all, more for keeping her in ignorance till death, than for all the rest.' 'Oh, Howel!' I know it has been my own fault and my father's, but that doesn't make it better; however, I will try. All the rest have deserted me, and wished me hanged. But I have to thank you, who always despised me, for being here now, and for your anxiety about me. I know it. remember me, for God's sake and for hers!' And so they parted. We enter the hall, and peep into the different rooms. And, you know, clergymen are ath good ath any one in London.' The colonel sighs. 'As to Mr Owen and his wife, they might be introduced into any society.' Only they live so near.' Why did Mr Prothero come, papa? and am not I a farmer, Master Harold?' 'And tho am I, my dear.' 'And tho am I, mamma,' lisps Dot, exactly as lisps her mamma. Well, I liked him from the first. I thant allow that, Gwynne, the ith much too pretty.' 'I feel very thankful that it is all over, and very unnatural.' 'Yes, unnatural. 'Treue for you, my dear. Does he not, Mr Jones?' Why, you cannot light a candle to us. '720, Owen. shouts Mr Prothero, 'he has you now, brother Jo.' 'Not at all. 'The little hypocrite,' cries Owen. 'She can be anything she likes,' says Mrs Jones. asked Mrs Jenkins, in an undertone, of her neighbour. Well, it is no loss for you. and no fault of yours." 'Hush, Davy, bach! Such has been our tale, and 'such is life!'
