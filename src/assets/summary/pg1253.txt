 She took service on another farm where she tended the poultry; and as she was well thought of by her master, her fellow-workers soon grew jealous. But she grew frightened and screamed, and he walked off. she exclaimed. She replied, smilingly, that it was wrong of him to make fun of her. no, I am in earnest,â? He kissed her again and she went home. They met in yards, behind walls or under isolated trees. and the memory of âMonsieur,â? But in spite of all this, she was happy. Paul explained the pictures to Felicite. And, in fact, this was her only literary education. Then, âWhy donât you go and play?â? One autumn evening, they struck out for home through the meadows. Oxen, lying in the pastures, gazed mildly at the passing persons. âNo, no! not so fast,â? warned Felicite. But Felicite took no credit to herself, and probably never knew that she had been heroic. In those days, Trouville was not greatly patronised. She took them in her little chemise, as she had no bathing suit, and afterwards her nurse dressed her in the cabin of a customs officer, which was used for that purpose by other bathers. Not a sound in the village, not a soul on the sidewalk. They always hung around the kitchen, or approached Felicite when she and the children were out walking. The husband, however, did not show himself. She fussed about the shoes, the rosary, the book and the gloves. She took it with the proper feeling, but did not experience the same delight as on the previous day. as she put it. In August, his father took him on a coasting-vessel. He was growing handsome, had a good figure, a tiny moustache, kind eyes, and a little leather cap that sat jauntily on the back of his head. Others, on the edge of the dock, neighed at the sight of the ocean. She never mentioned her anxieties, however. âOh, yes, your nephew!â? Her strength returned. Autumn passed. âNot yet,â? And down she jumped. The next morning, at daybreak, she called at the doctorâs. âIt must be for some one else,â? thought she; and she pulled the knocker violently. For two nights, Felicite never left the corpse. Of the latter, one more especially haunted her. Once she came in from the garden, all upset. yes, yes, you do not forget her!â? But Felicite went there every day. One night, the driver of the mail in Pont-lâEveque announced the Revolution of July. He was called Loulou. Your servant, sir! I salute you, Marie!â? She rushed to the place. All things moved silently, like ghosts. In her isolation, the parrot was almost a son, a love. But she believed that he had been poisoned, and although she had no proofs whatever, her suspicion rested on Fabu. Really, it seemed as if Loulou would never come back to his home. âThey have stolen him,â? thought Felicite. She put him in her room. By means of a board, Loulou was set on a portion of the chimney which advanced into the room. As she was unable to communicate with people, she lived in a sort of somnambulistic torpor. With his scarlet wings and emerald body, it was really the image of Loulou. But she looked down upon the customs of Pont-lâEveque, put on airs, and hurt Feliciteâs feelings. Few friends regretted her loss, for her manner was so haughty that she did not attract them. Ten days later the time to journey from Besancon , the heirs arrived. For a moment she tottered, and had to sit down. But, being too deaf to hear, she caught only one word: âPneumonia.â? like Madame,â? âForgive me,â? she commanded. But Felicite was blind now, and she took him and laid him against her cheek. Everybody knelt.
