 âClear âenoughâ is just what it isnât,â? âI might feel injured,â? âI donât know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.â? âLeft him to us?â? âWhy on what I began by boring you withâ"his extraordinary mind.â? âAs exhibited in his writings?â? âAnd whatâs it all about?â? âThereâs one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of the best talk and of the worst.â?Â He looked, in saying this, as if he meant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that neither of them mattered if a man wasnât a real gentleman.Â Perhaps it was what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being right by putting the truth in a slightly different way.Â âThe only thing that really counts for oneâs estimate of a person is his conduct.â?Â He had his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in having ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always gave in.Â My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly added that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no exception. âSo you came to see where the fascination resides?Â Well, youâve seen!â? âThe humiliation?â? âWhy mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the purchaser of a ticket.â? âOh, you canât âseeâ it!â? âYou donât!Â You mustnât suppose heâs good-looking,â? âWhy his wife says heâs lovely!â? Saltram,â? âBut isnât it an awful drawback?â? âAwfulâ"quite awful.â? âI mean isnât it positively fatal?â? âA want of will?â? âA want of dignity.â? âAnd how much do they come to?â? âBut what is there, after all, at his age, to show?â? I asked.Â âTo âshowâ if you will, there isnât much, since his writing, mostly, isnât as fine, isnât certainly as showy, as his talk.Â Moreover two-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.Â âShowingâ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,â? âAnd what would his talk just have been?â? âWait over till next week,â? Lady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with âgrounds,â? I remember crying, âsheâll be put by me;â? Miss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness, looked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.Â âItâs too bad I canât see him.â? âYou mean Gravener wonât let you?â? âBut you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.â? âWe havenât happened to talk of him,â? Miss Anvoy thought a moment.Â Then, âI should like to see them,â? âAnd how did you find him?â? âYou didnât like him?â? âYou want to do that?â? She stared, smiled, then returned: âWhy my idea has been to help him!â? but not to think too much about it.Â âTo take it, but not to thank you for it?â? âWell, since you ask me!â? âRight there on the spot?â? âIt was very handsome.â?Â Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see it was with an effort.Â âThirty pounds.â? âStraight out of her pocket?â? âYou say Saltram was very fine?â? âAnd I know what youâve enjoyed.â?Â After a moment I added: âHad he peradventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?â? âPerhaps even!Â And what was it all about?â? âAnd how he has always been right on that great question.â? âOn what great question, dear lady, hasnât he been right?â? âOf what other great men can you equally say it?â"and that he has never, but never, had a deflexion?â? âI mean yours.â? âSheâs everything to her wretched father.Â She writes me every postâ"telling me to smooth her auntâs pillow.Â Iâve other things to smooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.Â She wonât receive her Coxon relationsâ"sheâs angry at so much of her money going to them.Â Besides, sheâs hopelessly mad,â? There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there would be the way the question would strike a man of the world.Â He had lighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have it to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly artificial: âIn fact itâs a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling different ways.â? âAnd you want me to decide between you?Â I decide in advance for Miss Anvoy.â? âSome earnest and âloyalâ seeker,â? âThe flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence as may aid the light thatâs in it to shine upon the human race.Â The individual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the spiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.â? âFor Moral Truth.Â Thatâs what Sir Gregory calls it.â? âAnd you consider thereâs nothing?â? âThe sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?â? âAnd any one she chooses to invite.â? âBut she has invited you,â? âFor Miss Anvoyâs own use?â? âFor Miss Anvoyâs own useâ"on the occasion of her prospective marriage.Â She was discouragedâ"the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.Â She was afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed either not earnest enough or not poor enough.Â On the receipt of the first bad news about Mr. Anvoyâs affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the sacrifice for her.Â As the situation in New York got worse she repeated her proposal.â? âYou mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?â? âAnd you blame her for that?â? I asked with some intensity. âNo, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of it.â?Â Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more, as we found, to be revealed.Â Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival, had brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.Â The Coxons were in possession of the house in Regentâs Park, and Miss Anvoy was in dreary lodgings.Â George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide called, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at Wimbledon.Â The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had been sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the ladies up.Â Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour, on the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to Wimbledon.Â This was the girlâs second glimpse of our great man, and I was interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the first appeared to have been confirmed.Â On her replying after consideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldnât fail to be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her use of this last word to question her further. âHeâll be all the better to-night,â? There would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour, as I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in my mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to George Gravener in the railway-carriage.Â I watched her in the light of this queer possibilityâ"a formidable thing certainly to meetâ"and I was aware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her very looks and tones.Â At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me she was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had begun already to feel.Â I had come up to town with her the next day and had been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on her guard.Â She would show as little as possible before she should be ready to show everything.Â What this final exhibition might be on the part of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great sport to forecast.Â It would have been exciting to be approached by her, appealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightnât find myself in such a predicament.Â If there was really a present rigour in the situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she would have to get out of her difficulty by herself.Â It wasnât I who had launched her and it wasnât I who could help her.Â I didnât fail to ask myself why, since I couldnât help her, I should think so much about her.Â It was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited impatiently to see whether she wouldnât have told Mrs. Mulville a portion at least of what I had learned from Gravener.Â But I saw Mrs. Mulville was still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadnât come as a conciliatory bride.Â That she had come in some other character was the only thing that fitted all the appearances.Â Having for family reasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a manner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumbleâ"I mean of the continuous hum of Saltramâs thoughtâ"and my uneasiness tended to keep me quiet.Â There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my prudence surmounted my curiosity.Â I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked over the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why I didnât hear from Wimbledon.Â I had a reproachful note about something or other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxonâs niece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent untoward events. âAnd why in the world doesnât she do do?â? I asked. âThe Coxon Fund?â? âAwful?â? âWhy, to have anything to do with such an idea oneâs self.â? âSheâs many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?â? âAnd Gravener does, if not his own; and thatâs the whole difficulty?â? âThe difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her poor auntâs solicitor.Â Itâs clear that by Lady Coxonâs will she may have the money, but itâs still clearer to her conscience that the original condition, definite, intensely implied on her uncleâs part, is attached to the use of it.Â She can only take one view of it.Â Itâs for the Endowment or itâs for nothing.â? âThe Endowment,â? âAre you repeating Mr. Gravenerâs words?â? âRuth doesnât insist on that,â? said Mrs. Mulville; âand itâs, for her, exactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral obligation.â? âAre you repeating her words?â? âFor several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.â? âAnd thatâs why you didnât write?â? âWell thenâ"sail!â? said Mrs. Mulville, getting up. I asked.Â âLook out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.Â Heâll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will make an Endowment a scandal.â? âA scandal?â? âSo do you!â? she asked, âas well as the enthusiasm of oneâs adhesion?â? âSeeing how wonderfully youâve threshed the whole thing out,â? âAnd why should that prevent?â? Why do such things concern her?â? I asked, much at a loss. âYou mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?Â She has told me so herself,â? âIt wasnât to tell you so that I wanted to see you,â? âWell I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.â? âAnd to invite me to do the same?â? âAnd you donât mean to?â? âThereâs only one consideration that would make me,â? âWhy is it sent through you?â? âRather than you?â? âMy relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,â? âNo, Iâm not,â? âRemoved?â? âNo indeed.Â Itâs at home, locked up.â? There was another great silence, and then she said âGo back and destroy it.â?
