 Acts xii. 6. The Voice and the Peak. said Olga. said Nick. "But this man hasn't got any manners at all," objected Olga. It's like having a stinging-nettle in the house. That's the point," said Nick sententiously. She was stitching with neat rapidity. "I'm not. That's just how my wife fell in love with me. "I should take steps to be nice to him if I were you, before the mischief spreads." She was slightly flushed. said Nick. said Nick. "I don't think you are a good judge on that subject, Nick," remarked his niece judiciously. said Nick. "Of course, Sir Kersley Whitton recommended him," conceded Olga. "Oh, I suppose so. "I shouldn't worry if I were you," protested Olga. "And get up to mischief," said Nick. "No, I'm on the job, overlooking the whole crowd of you, and I'll do it thoroughly. questioned Olga. She was stitching so busily that she did not observe his approach until escape was out of the question; but she would not have retreated in any case. She was inwardly wondering what he had come for. said Olga at last. she asked, barely restraining her irritation. she said quickly. "Thank you, Olga. "I am Miss Ratcliffe to you," she said. "Yes," he said, after a moment, "I should think your pulse must be about a hundred. he said again; and then, because she would not, he laid a detaining hand upon her work. It clenched slowly, that was all. "I?" "Even so, fair lady. It will be a little lesson for youâ"in surgery. "Oh, I can't! "Besides, you did the mischief, remember." She knew that there was no escape for her, knew, moreover, that she richly deserved her punishment; yet, as he held open the surgery-door for her, she made one more appeal. "Oh, but you'll enjoy that," he said. "I don't want it. She raised it at once to her lips, feeling as if she had no choice, and drank with shuddering distaste. "I always have hated sal volatile," she said, as she finished the draught. Yes, I know it's bleeding; but you needn't shudder like that. She obeyed his instructions herself with a set face and a quaking heart, suppressing a sick shudder from time to time, finally achieving the desired end with a face so ghastly that the victim of her efforts laughed outright. "Whom are you most sorry for, yourself or me?" he wanted to know. Again his insistence carried the day. She was not going to be brought to book as though she had been a naughty child. said Max. She was longing to go, but stood her ground lest departure should look like flight. "You!" she said, with withering scorn. "You!" She was as vivid in that moment as the flare of the sunset; and into the eyes of the man who leaned against the table coolly appraising her there came an odd little gleam of satisfactionâ"the gleam that comes into the eyes of the treasure-hunter at the first glint of gold. said Max, smiling openly. Sit down, won't you, and tell me?" he asked, and drew in a mouthful of smoke which he puffed at the ceiling. "Oh, I say!" said Max, opening his eyes, "that's the cruellest thing you've done yet. "Yes, isn't it? she said. Again he puffed the smoke upwards and watched it ascend. said Olga. He turned at that and surveyed her quite seriously. said Olga. "Yes," said Max, with a sudden twinkle in his green eyes. "He's only fresh." "No, he isn't. He's vicious. He'll have to have it." "You go on up the drive, my dear, while I take him across the turf." "I wish you would," said Olga. "He is much too strong for a woman to manage." She knew that as an exhibition of skilled horsemanship the spectacle she had just witnessed was faultless; but it gave her no pleasure, and there was no admiration in the eyes that followed the distant galloping figure with the merciless whip that continued active as long as she could see it. She was laughing as she came, evidently at some joke that clung to her memory. she said. "I'm all foam. Olga got up quickly. "It's not in the least extraordinary. I like plenty of colour." she said, with gay imperiousness. And why didn't you bring him too?" "He is wonderfully good, you know, and takes immense care of us all." "Oh, really, Violet! She is one of the deepest people I know, and absolutely devoted to Nickâ"and he to her." "Oh, I thought you knew that. "You scandalize me. "Presently, my child. He is not at home just at present. Bruce." "He told me." "I don't take the smallest interest in his doings." she enquired. "I should hate him quite as badly even if he were the only man in the world." "I haven't! "Of course he hasn't! thrust back Olga, goaded to self-defence. She tossed away her cigarette with the words, and turned inwards, sweeping Olga with her with characteristic energy. She was never still for long in this mood. They passed through the great hall to a Gothic archway in the south wall, close to the wonderful stained window. Olga glanced up at it with a slight shiver as she passed below. she said. "I don't think so," returned Violet. We all do it now. That is a drawback certainly. "No, you are not to wear that red thing. I like you best in white." But not colours. "I'll fly round to Redlands for the motor. She watched its flight with fascinated eyes, so sudden was it, so swift, and so unerringly direct. He laughed at her from the sofa, on which he sprawled at length. She was for the moment too angry to speak. "Sit down," he said. "I'm not such an idiot. said Olga. he suggested. she enquired bluntly. she said. "She is," said Max. "Even so, fair lady." she asked slowly. questioned Olga. He hesitated for a second. Then, "cancer," he said briefly. said Max, thrusting his hands into his pockets. "I don't see why you shouldn't tell me that." "I don't agree with you!" "It matters a lot to me. She was a friend of mine. "But it wouldn't have done much good to anyone if you had seen her. "I might have taken her things at least," said Olga. She clenched her hands unconsciously. she said. But he remained motionless, his hand upon it. he said. said Max. She collected herself and spoke. "Certainly," he said, "if you will promise me first not to go to 'The Ship' till after the funeral." "Simply because it wouldn't be good for you," he made calm reply. Yes, she had won! he demanded. "But you won't!" "It's no good asking you anything. said Max. Yes, she was listeningâ"listening tensely, because she could not help herself. "I'm sorry you think me a brute," he proceeded. "I don't think anyone else does, but that's a detail. That's one of the grand obstacles in the medical career. she said. "Oh, but surely the help you give far outweighs that!" she said. he said. "No," she answered quickly. she said, with somewhat daring significance. said Max keenly. "I am enchanted," he declared. "No, you needn't! "Of course, I can. But he only laughed at her, and turned to the door. "I shouldn't be so cocksure of that if I were you," he said, opening it with a flourish. "I have a wonderful knack of getting what I want." she said. "Yes, really," he said. "I had no idea you were so accomplished," he remarked, as they skimmed up the long Priory drive. "I should have thought you were much too nervous to drive a car." "I've noticed that he's fairly agile," commented Max. "He was wounded in action," she said shortly. "And so entered Parliament in a blaze of glory," he said. she said. said Max kindly. said Max. "He must find it a tight squeeze, notwithstanding his size. "Yes," he said with deliberation. "I don't question your cleverness, fair lady;â"only your wisdom. "Perhaps, when you have quite finished your lecture, you will get out," she said, "and let me do the same. He turned and descended, held up a hand to her, then, as she ignored it, stooped to guard her dress from the wheel. "I'm so sorry, Colonel Campion. He turned at once to Max. "Hullo, Wyndham! You, is it? She was in fact lying at careless ease half-dressed upon the bed, deeply immersed in a book with a lurid paper cover. "Back already. Sit downâ"anywhere! And why?" He said he was coming here in any case." "You might let me have it. We mustn't keep his Objectionable Majesty waiting. Olga hesitated momentarily. "But he didn't get there in time." Olga glanced round in surprise. He is with your brother." asked Olga, trying to imagine this phenomenon. "No, I supply the words and he the argument generally. "So he can go without you now with a clear conscience." "So he can. I hated him then. But he didn't love me enough for that, and nothing else would have satisfied me. "Nor I, dear. That's where the fascination comes in. We mustn't dazzle the impressionable Max, must we? laughed Violet. "I am coming to protect you from the dragon, but I shall probably end by protecting the dragon from you. She was somewhat dismayed as they passed through the archway into the hall to find Max and his host still there; but as they were at the further end and apparently deeply engrossed in conversation, she decided that Violet's gay remarks were scarcely likely to have made any impression, even if they had penetrated so far. laughed Violet, giving him two fingers. "Of course, I know that it's Bruce you come to see. enquired Violet. "On the contrary," said Max. I'm so thirsty. It's close to you. he said. said Max, holding out his hand. "I should like to sample Miss Campion's taste in literature." "He is inured to the worst. "It's very kind of Olga to provide us with distractions," said Nick, as he dropped into an arm-chair, with a cigar, "but I almost think we are better off without them. asked Max. He turned his head sharply, and looked up at Max who stood on the hearth-rug. "I?" The corners of Max's mouth went down. And I humbly beg to offer you my sympathy." "If it isn't an empty phrase, I value it." "I don't deal in empty phrases as a rule," said Max. "So do I," said Max. said Max. "What I said." "It's not an empty phrase," he added. "I observe certain limits," said Nick. Not often. "No, pardon me, not yours!" Again his eyes took a leaping glance at his companion. Doggedly Max faced it. said Nick. "Olga." I see." he asked rather curtly. said Max. "No, my friend. "I don't want her to," said Max. he said, a half-whimsical note of pleading in his voice. "I don't mean to harry her." Nick nodded. "I don't propose to spend two years over mine," said Max. Nick grinned with baffling amiability. "No, I don't think. I know. "That girl's a siren," he said. "You lead the way," he said. "I should think so, as the lady smokes them herself." he said. But he did not utter a word. They passed into the drawing-room with the lazy, tolerant air of men expecting to be amused; and Olga, with all her keenness, was very far from suspecting aught of what had just passed between them. I like you sitting there." "I promised to go and say good-night to the boys," said Olga, who had sprung up somewhat precipitately at Max's approach. I'm coming back." She was gone with the words, a vanishing grey vision, the quick closing of the door shutting her from sight. she said. "I?" he interposed. "I won't put that into words. she said lightly. "I don't pretend." she said. He laughed. "Naturally," said Max. "Why not?" said Max. Max got up abruptly and moved to the window. said Max. "I should have thought you would have been virile enough to like rank things. To judge by the tobacco you smoke, you do." said Nick. "Very bad for you," said Max. She snapped her fingers at him. "Then I shall certainly continue the pernicious habit. said Nick. said Nick. "It's quite probably true. She tossed her head. "No, I can't," he returned daringly. "I should have thought you would have been the first on the list." said Violet. "Perhaps you are not aware of the fact that the sweetest fruit is generally out of reach." "You might have let me say that," said Nick. "But the man is a liar in any case, and I hope he will give me the opportunity to tell him so." "I had no idea you were so pugnacious. "Why?" said Nick. remonstrated Nick. "In miniature," suggested Max. "He is actually proposing to go and kick Major Hunt-Goring becauseâ"" He broke off short. "Why?" she said quickly. "Nick, why do you want to kick Major Hunt-Goring?" She was evidently too proud to accept help from this quarter. laughed Violet. Max laughed in a fashion that made her wince, but Nick's fingers squeezed hers protectingly. "I don't think I shall ever dare to go to bed at all after that," said Nick. "I don't often get the opportunity to jeer at a genius," she said. said Max. "No, I never ask favours. "Saves trouble, too," he suggested. "Invariably," said Max. "I shouldn't recommend it to everybody." "And it's horribly selfish," put in Olga. said Max. said Olga. "Why not?" She hesitated. "I'm not in the mood for it. asked Max. He turned to Violet, faintly smiling. She rose, flinging a gay glance at Olga. "Just two turns!" she said. said Nick. She knew that he would be engaged at the cottage-hospital that morning, but it was one of Dr. Ratcliffe's strict rules that the car should never be used unprofessionally without express permission from himself or his assistant. Naturally Olga resented having to observe this rule in her father's absence and her manner betrayed as much, but she was too conscientious to neglect its observance. said Max, pausing. "I don't see what that has to do with it," she said. "With me, you mean. Very likely not. "He is going part of the way," said Olga, striving for dignity. said Max. "I don't want one of the boys," Olga spoke with sudden irritation. "No, it isn't absurd. she asked him scornfully. "Nick, it's really too silly for words. "I shouldn't harass the man if I were you, Olga. He's been out all night." "No," said Max. asked Olga eagerly; and then restrained herself with annoyance. "Nick, don't you think it absurd that Violet and I shouldn't motor over to Brethaven without a man to take care of us? "It's not that at all," said Max curtly. Nick laughed outright, openly heartless. "Nick, I'm not nasty!" "I should detest you if I were Max," said Nick, squeezing her affectionately with his one wiry arm. You simply couldn't." "Why not?" said Nick. He's so cold-blooded and cynical." said Nick. said Olga. "He was sent for last thing by some people who live in that filthy alleyâ"near the green pond. A child was choking. said Olga, turning very white. "The child is better. Naturally I lodged a complaint, and finally got at the whole story. That's only a detail, but I mention it in case you should be tempted to broach the subject to him. "But, Nick!" "I wish I'd known before I was so cross to him. laughed Nick. "No, I'm not. "Oh, of course," said Nick. Nick grinned. "A matter of opinion!" laughed Nick. Yours, "Olga." She was not very anxious to supply the information, but Violet was insistent and soon possessed herself of the full details of the argument which she seemed to find highly amusing. "Oh, my dear, he's in love with me of course!" she said "I discovered that the first night I was with you. Hence his solicitude." "I'm not so sure of that," said Olga. Yes, Olga had seen it; but somehow she did not think it meant that. laughed Violet. "But you needn't be afraid, dear. said Olga. "I don't think he is quite so callous as that," Olga said, but even as she said it she wondered. said Mrs. Briggs. "I might 'a' known. 'Black magic,' she says. "But there's one thing as you'll both be glad to know," she said, lowering her voice confidentially, "she died easy, pore soul, in spite of 'im. 'E 'olds it up to the light, and looks at it. And I just run up to see. asked Violet. "I've no call to fret," she said. Well, well! She's gone, pore soul. She rose briskly, and went to a cupboard. But I thought I'd save the rest for when you came. She was quite cheery by the time her two visitors took their leave. said Violet. I like to drop in unexpectedly when Bruce is away, and make sure that they are treated properly." No, Olga was fain to admit it. She realized vaguely that this form of callousness was not so hideous as she had at first deemed it. he said to Olga and drew her into her father's little smoking-room at the side of the hall almost before the words were uttered. he said. "Of course, we needn't," he said. said Max, with a cynical lift of the shoulders. "No!" He turned to the door. She was possessed by an almost overwhelming desire to know, and yet no words could she find in which to ask. said Max, pausing in the act of opening the door. "I had been thinking that perhaps you were getting fond of her, andâ"andâ"I should be sorry if that happened, because I know she isn't in earnest. She dared not look at him. asked Max. She was thankful that he did not press her to be more explicit. "Not for Violet," said Olga. he said. Olga hesitated. "Yes." he said. "Oh, I enjoy Major Hunt-Goring," she said. "You leave him to me. said Olga. said Olga quickly. said Violet. "I should like to introduce you to a form of yachting that is not imprisonment," said Hunt-Goring. "Oh, I should have to be mistress of the yacht for that." "Even so," he rejoined significantly. he protested. asked Max. he asked. "Too busy," she returned briefly. he asked. "Mend." "Stockings," said Olga. said Max. "Including yours," said Olga. "Oh, I say!" he protested. It's my misfortune, not my fault." Max glanced towards them before he abruptly started another subject with Olga. "About you?" said Olga. He laughed and looked away. "Even so, fair lady. Briggs." said Max. she said quickly. "No, I don't pity you at all," Olga said. said Max. "Nick." "I should like to wring his skinny little neck," said Max. said Olga indignantly. he said, with a smile. "No," she admitted rather grudgingly. "I don't think you are afraid of anyone or anything. asked Max. "Oh, but you do!" "No, I don't!" said Max. "I go my own way, that's all. said Olga. said Max. He put the question with obvious indifference, yet his green eyes still studied her critically. he said. "I don't know," she murmured somewhat incoherently. he said. said Max. said Violet, detaching her attention from Major Hunt-Goring for a moment. "It's confoundedly lonely up at The Warren," he remarked pathetically, as he lounged after her into the sunshine. "No. Well, it's a fact. I like society." laughed Violet. "Hullo, little one! she asked him frigidly. he said. she said. He laughed again, that hateful confidential laugh of his. She was putting together her work with evident determination. he suggested. "I?" said Olga, quivering disdain in the word. he said genially. "And it won't be the first time, what? You were always such a nice, sociable little girl till then." He laughed again in his easy fashion. "Oh, pardon me! I hardly think your memory is as short as that." "Very well, Major Hunt-Goring," she said breathlessly. He bent to her. "But you must give," he said. "Very well," she said again. she said in a whisper halfâ"choked. He turned them upon the white, shrinking face of the girl who stood rigid but unresisting within the circle of his arm. "But you didn't pay your debt, you know," said Hunt-Goring amiably. "I won't trouble you now, however, as we are no longer alone. said Max. "Oh, go away!" "Not going," said Max. Then he sat down on the table and waited, whistling below his breath. said Max. "I'm not!" she cried stormily. "I'm not! "No, I don't. Sit down, and stop crying!" "I'm not crying!" she sobbed. said Max. "Sit down now! Now, don't cry! He turned to the pile of stockings he had brought in with him, and began to sort them into pairs. "I'll finish this." said Olga. "I don't know. "I don't know. He said she had gone in. said Max, frowning over his darning. "She is probably reading some obscene novel, and won't be wanting you." "Max!" "I apologize," said Max. "I wish Mitchel would run into something and kill him!" said Olga, with sudden vehemence. "Dr. she said at last, her voice very low. said Max. she said. "No." he said severely. "I don't answer to it, except in business hours." "Max, then! "On one condition," he said. The corner of his mouth went up. She hesitated momentarily. asked Max. asked Max. "Yes," she said, under her breath. "Max!" "Yes, he did. She winced. she said with vehemence. she said feverishly. "No, it doesn't. she said. "But that isn't enough. he said. Max got up. "Only as a temporary expedient," he said. She hesitated. she hazarded. "It's very good of you," she said with feeling. said Max. "Like, yet unlike," said Max. said Max. He put his arm around her, flashing a swift look over her as he did it. "No, I've made friends with Max," she said. "Best we can do under the circumstances," said Max. asked Olga. "I am," he said. I can send it up." I'll come down," said Max. He turned away towards the house, but stopped abruptly as Violet suddenly sauntered forth. She was yawning as she came. said Olga, with a very unwonted touch of asperity. said Max. "Nick can do that," said Olga. "No, thanks. I'm too sleepy. "On the contrary. "Oh, really! said Max. "Not in the least; quite delighted." "No, thanks. "Go on, Max!" grinned Nick. asked Violet, rousing herself in response to Olga's hand on her arm. "I am," he said. said Nick. said Nick. He's been dangling after me half the afternoon. said Olga, turning crimson. "Max is only an interlude." "Perhaps, I can't say I'm enamoured of him, though. Then he turned to his niece. said Nick. "I haven't got over it myself yet. "Nick! "India, my childâ"naked and unadulterated India! "Nick! He laughed. "Ladies are admitted," said Nick. "India is a large place," he pointed out. But he had the spirit of an Olympian, and we won at a canter." she said. "Of course she'll want to go, Nick. "Oh, but that's Ã¦ons ago!" He kept his eyes shut. she said. said Nick. He lodged his head against her shoulder after the fashion she most loved. It's rude. "Nick, you know, don't you, that you are dearer to me than anyone else in the world?" He put up his hand and patted her cheek. he said. said Nick. "Bully, wasn't it?" She hesitated a little. "Nick, I'm going to make a perfectly awful suggestion." said Nick. "I don't, dear,â"formidable as you can be. said Nick, sitting up. He bent suddenly forward and kissed it. he said. "I, Nick? she said, with candid eyes raised to his. "Nick! "No, you're not, dear. asked Olga. "Not to-night. "But it was a ripping idea of yours," he said. She began to feel as if her limbs were weighted, and the fruit itself danced giddily before her aching eyes. "Oh, Max," she said, with a painful gasp, "my raspberries!" he said. said Max grimly. She was silent for a little. He kept his hand upon her head, and she was glad of its support though she wished it had not been his. "It is," said Max. "We will go indoors." "Oh, but I must pick up my raspberries first, andâ"there's a whole rowâ"moreâ"to gather yet." he said. "And oh, Max, I do feel so sick." he said. "I'm going to carry you in." She raised a feeble protest to which he paid no more attention than if it had been the buzzing of a fly. he said, and she obeyed him like a child. "Thank you very much," murmured Olga. I'll come up again in half an hour and give you something for your head. "No! said Max brusquely. he asked. "Yes," she whispered. said Max. I'll do it all." she said. he said. "Hullo, darling!" "Taking care of you," said Nick. "It's night, isn't it?" "Keeps me in form." "Is Max here?" "No," said Nick. she persisted. "Yes. He's been in now and then." "Am I ill, Nick?" she asked, with a touch of nervousness. said Olga. said Nick. "I'm here. She squeezed his hand. But I had to get those raspberries. He bent down over her. "I don't want Max," she whispered. "I'll go like a bird," Max said, "if you will let me take your pulse first. "I won't hurt you, Olga," he said. Again his voice was softened to a great gentleness; yet it compelled. he asked. "No," she whispered back. "No," she said again. She raised her eyes to his grave face. "Max!" said Max. She was sure his eyes gleamed mockery. he said. She knew she would never have the courage. He waited a few seconds more, then as she remained silent he laid his hand again on hers and pressed it lightly. he said. said Nick. "Of course I will." "Yes, dear Nick, a promise." "I'll go." But he was obviously loth to leave her, and she detained him to assure him how greatly she loved to be in his care. said Nick. She began to answer in the negative, but tripped up unexpectedly. "Why?" "Nick, you haven't told him aboutâ"that scheme of ours?" Nick knelt down beside her. I wanted to know if I'd better go on with it, if he thoughtâ"in view of to-day's misfortuneâ"it might upset your health, supposing you were allowed to go. said Olga. Nick chuckled a little. "And so couldn't say for certain," ended Nick. "Why not?" said Olga. "I don't know," said Nick. "No, I'm not," said Nick simply. "I shouldn't like to see him writhing in hell," said Nick. "Yes, really, little sweetheart. asked Nick humorously. "He is so far as I am concerned," said Olga. asked Nick. "Oh, in some things perhaps. But not in a matter of this sort. "I shouldn't be too hard on him, kiddie. "I should like to know what they are," said Olga. asked Nick. "Nick! She was sure he had not cared for her before that. She began to be a little frightened, to cast back her thoughts over all her intercourse with Max to ascertain if she had ever given him the smallest reason for loving her. She knew women did these silly things, but surely not menâ"and hard-headed men like Max! Again, as morning broke, she told herself that this thing was an impossibility after all, that Nick had been misled, or had spoken in jest. Yes, she was sure Max was much too shrewd to let himself be caught by a girl who did not even want him. She was finally aroused without ceremony by Violet, who skipped airily into the room, clad in a daring sea-green wrapper that revealed more of her charms than it concealed. "Oh, my dear soul, are you awake?" asked Max on the other side of the door. urged Olga. he said curtly. laughed Violet, with audacious mirth. He turned his eyes straight upon her; they were piercingly green in the morning light. she said. "And if Olga is not requiring your professional services?" she suggested daringly. "I don't mind at all," stammered Olga in reply. he said. Again, rather feebly, she laughed. "It seems a pity," she said. "I shouldn't worry," said Max. "Besides, it's Sunday. "I could, though," said Olga, "if the fruit wouldn't keep till Monday." He laughed. "Thank you!" said Olga. said Max. "I have been waiting for your pulse to steady down," he said coolly. said Olga. she said, with burning cheeks. he said. he said. "Yes, yes," said Olga rather hurriedly. "Of course we are friends. He let her hand slip from his. "Oh, Max! "He congratulated me," said Max. "Max!" "I don't want any discussion," she hastened to tell him. said Max. "He must be told," she said. "I don't see why." he asked. she said. He turned to the door. she said, in a tone of protest. "Yes, really," said Max. They passed under her window. They paused. she called then. she asked. "No." Impulse moved her. She watched him nursing the flame between his hands, firm, powerful hands, full of confidence. "No. Nick grinned over his shoulder. Oh, no, not quite, believe me. said Nick. He turned unexpectedly and gave her one of his shrewd glances. "I'll go and kick him for you if you like," he said. he said. "No, Nick. "India," said Olga. "Nick, you're a darling! But I haven't." said Nick. She knew that she coloured, but she faced him notwithstanding. "No, I didn't. "Of course you can," she said. She watched him go, and then closed her eyes, slightly frowning. She was still pondering the unpleasant subject when the housemaid suddenly presented herself at the open door. said Olga, with a start. "But they've been gathered, miss. "No, I didn't. I dropped them all too." asked Olga quickly. She was growing a little tired of inactivity, notwithstanding the undeniable languor that had succeeded the previous day's headache. "No, no, my dear fellow! But Max had already departed upon his errand. He turned back smiling to the girl. "I don't think lying still suits me. he asked. That is to say, he is Dad's half-brother, but nearer my age than Dad's." He nodded in humorous comprehension. "His only daughter," she said. too." "Yes, of course I have heard of him, Miss Ratcliffe. It will give me much pleasure to meet him." said Olga, with shining eyes. Olga hesitated in momentary confusion. said Nick briefly. ejaculated Olga. He laughed at her quietly. laughed Nick. "Is Max a celebrity too, then?" asked Olga quickly. "He is going to be one," the great doctor answered, with conviction. she said. "Nick! Olga glanced up sharply, but he was not looking at her. said Olga. "Oh, ages! "Oh, I am too busy for frivolities of that sort," said Max. She was spared the trouble of administering one, however, by the reappearance of the housemaid. She rose. "Thank you for rescuing my raspberries," she said. he said. "Not yet. She was possessed by a ridiculous longing to rush out to her, to keep her from entering this man's presence, to warn herâ"to warn herâ"Of what? She was singing a Spanish love-song. she said, breaking off in the middle of her song. "He is not one of the roaring kind," said Max. "I don't think you have," he said. "I have! asked Max. You were very handsomeâ"in those days, weren't you?" "Yes. That's why I kept you. "Oh, of course! "It's not my way," he said. he said, and with characteristic decision marched him away. "This man for instance who might have beenâ"who should have beenâ"my father. "I don't know," said Olga soberly. "Oh, very well, my dear, very well! she asked. She was a Californian, and very Southern in temperament, I believe. "I always say whatever occurs to me," said Violet. asked Olga. He died before she did. He said everyone fell in love with her. "Besides, he gives me such lovely cigarettes. Have one, Allegretto. "No!" said Olga almost fiercely. "You promised me one, you know." She tossed him her cigarette-case carelessly. Abruptly he held up a warning finger. She watched him in silence. asked Violet. "Soon. "No, dear," said Violet. "Why not?" said Max unexpectedly. "I won't," said Olga. he said, and therewith followed Olga into the house. He kept it there. he said. She was silent. "No, no, you won't!" he said. Why?" "I won't, then," said Max. "I don't know. he said, in the same curt tone. "I don't know," she said again. She was silent. "Iâ"was a fool to ask you," she said. "I always do go," she protested into his silence. "Then I must go too, that's all." she asked quickly. said Max good-humouredly. she said. "The day after to-morrow," said Nick. "Nick, you are a darling!" He laughed. "Oh, very much. "He told me himself," said Nick. "He spoke in confidence," he said then. she asked quickly. "Sorry; I can't," said Nick. said Nick severely. I'll come down." "Why?" "A man has to think of that, you know." she retorted. She tossed her head. Max laughed again. she said, and through her deep voice there ran a sinister note that seemed to mingle, oddly vibrant, with the echoing strings of the instrument. Max grunted. Well, you ought to know." "Why?" he asked. "No," said Olga. She knew that Max saw her go, knew with sure intuition that he would seize the opportunity of her return to secure those few minutes alone with her that he had desired. She was not mistaken. The room was in darkness. she said, a hint of desperation in her voice. "I have not. Sit down, won't you? "He was here to-day, wasn't he?" proceeded Max. "Yes. Max grunted. "No, I don't. he asked then. she said. "We are neither of us that," remarked Max with a twist of the lips that was hardly a smile. "Oh, Max!" "I should say he wants you very much indeed," said Max. "But you needn't be scared on that account. he persisted. She raised her eyes with a feeling that he must be convinced of this at all costs. "Of course I'm not," she said. he said. "Max!" "But there is no question of my marrying him, is there?" she said at last. "He thrives on that," observed Max drily. he said. she asked at length. said Max. "It's no good talking round and round," he said. "He is the greatest friend I possess," Max said, still writing. "He made me." He laughed. "We are. Olga asked. "No. But I had my own way. She was wondering a little why he had chosen to make this confidence. said Max. he said. "It's not done nowadays." "I'm not afraid of that." She hesitated. "Well. she said quickly. "No, you needn't make any promise. said Olga rather breathlessly. He turned back to the writing-table with his supercilious smile. And I have work to do." She was sure that his profession came first with him. She liked him for that. She was convinced Max would think so, even pictured to herself the one-sided smile that such nonsense would provoke. She began to wander down that jungle path, in search of the monster that lurked there. She was about to secure the largest tiger that had ever been seen. She was running on foot through the jungle, eager and undismayed. Softly the door opened. Softly the door closed. she said. said the sympathetic Olga. I'm so hot." she said. "No. It's light enough. said Olga gently. "I'm going to give up Hunt-Goring," she said. said Olga fervently. "Yes," Violet went on. I know. said Olga quickly. But he has his points. Anyhow, take him off my hands for a spell. said Olga, with some impatience. I do detest him so." "But you manage to be nice to him." she demanded. Olga hesitated. she said. "Why not?" said Violet. she cried. Really, you needn't be so distressed. he said softly. "Nick, she's hysterical! "Better fetch Max," he said. "You!" "You!" he said with insistence. "Yes, dear, yes; he's going now," murmured Olga soothingly. She was no longer sobbing, but she shivered from head to foot. "Yes," said Max at last, in the tone of one continuing an interrupted conversation. "Of course you shall, dear," Olga made quick reply. He put his arm about her and lifted her to her feet; but she clung fast to Olga still. "I won't go without you, Allegro," she cried hysterically. he said. He turned back to Violet again, stooping low over her, his hand upon her wrist. She was back again in Violet's bedroom barely two minutes after she had left it, but the instant she entered she was conscious of a change. "Just a teaspoonfulâ"not a drop more. "You go back to bed now," he said. "She will sleep for some time." Then he stood up and turned quietly round. she asked. said Olga, lingering by the bed. "Yes." He put his hand on her shoulder, and wheeled her towards the door. Very softly she turned the door-handle, and peeped in. she called. "Yes. "Oh, but it wasn't," said Violet. Oh, no! "I couldn't possibly lie still and do nothing. And that's what has happened to me, really. "I'm so afraidâ"heâ"will come. Olga asked the question though she knew the inevitable answer. She was becoming seriously uneasy, though she sought to reassure herself with the thought that Violet's nerves were of the high-strung order and could scarcely have failed to suffer from the strain they had undergone. "Why, Max, of course! "Tell him what, dear?" questioned Olga. If he knows I'm trying to get out, he'll stop me. "He keeps the door," she said. Why, even last night he was there. He's so hard, Allegroâ"so hard and merciless. So you won't tell him, will you? She knew not what to say or do. "You promise, Allegro?" "Yes, of course, dear. he said, with her hand in his. she said. asked Max. he suggested. he said. said Max. She coloured hotly. "Perhaps I have," said Max. He lodged his chin on his hand, the better to study her. she asked him point-blank. "Of course," said Olga. He asked the question banteringly, yet his eyes were still upon her, unflaggingly intent. "I see. "No, never," said Olga. said Max. "Oh, of course!" said Olga quickly. He laughed. questioned Max. "I don't understand you," said Olga, in a tone that implied that she had no desire to do so. "No?" said Max indifferently. she said. asked Max, not to be thwarted. "Of course I should," said Olga. "I don't call that a very serious self-sacrifice." "No?" said Max. He gave her a very peculiar look, and pursed his lips for an instant as if about to whistle. "And if the unfortunate partner objected?" Max rose without comment and went to the ham. "Oh, really!" "But that illustrates my point. said Olga, with a glance at the clock. she said. She was very deft in all her ways, but to-day for some reason her hands were not quite so steady as usual. he asked. "Apparently," said Max, staring deliberately at a point some inches above Nick's head. "Hullo, Miss Campion! "Hullo, Nick!" she said indifferently. "Hullo, Allegro! She reached the table, and for the first time seemed to become aware of Max, seated on the opposite side of it. Olga glanced at him sharply, in apprehension of she knew not what. "I don't want yours," she said, in a deep voice that sounded almost like a menace. Then, "I am sorry," he said very deliberately. "But you mustn't smoke that sort any more. she said. "I had no choice." "I have a right to confiscate that sort," said Max. she flung back at him. "You amaze me," he said. She clenched her hands. "The coffee also. she said "Allegro, aren't you jealous? She was wrangling with Nick over the best means of attacking a boiled egg with one hand. She was beginning to understand Max's attitude at last; and it filled her with misgiving. She was obliged to leave her that afternoon to go to tea with an old patient of her father's who lived at the other end of the parish, Violet firmly refusing at the last moment to accompany her thither. "Not in the least. "Perhaps, however, it doesn't matter so much in your case. she said. "It's quite a selfish one," she said, seeking instinctively to reassure her. she said again. "Oh, I won't tell a soul," Violet promised. No, no! said Violet. "Just think of it, dear! You were born to be a slave. But I wasn't. "Of course you'll go, unlessâ"" she smiled a trifle maliciouslyâ""you mean me to go alone, as I certainly shall if you are going to be tiresome about it. So, you see, it's all perfectly safe. "Oh, but he's such a fiend!" said Violet sharply. Olga hesitated. insisted Violet. You were not yourself. "Ah, but tell me!" insisted Violet. He helped you back to your own room. she said, speaking rapidly. "I won't bear brutality from any man," she said. "Perhaps; a little," Olga admitted. I knew it. He crushed me down, so that I was at his mercy. "He gave you the pain-killer, dear," said Olga soothingly. she said. "I don't know what it is. "He gave me some the other day, when the heat upset me. I liked it." she said. "Of course," said Olga. "I don't know what you mean, dear. she said. said Olga, with shining eyes. Olga asked, feeling the silence to be slightly oppressive. He laughed drily. "Not that sort. "But you know the language?" "Oh, did you know him?" "Six years," said Max. But I was at school then. said Olga, and then with a touch of shyness, "I'm sorry, Max." His time was up." she said. "I don't think he thought so. she said. "I?" he said. "I had other things to think about. said Olga, swift to intervene once more. He nodded. She is married to Trevor Mordaunt the writer. "Why, yes! Nick knows him, I believe." "Very likely. asked Olga, with interest. said Olga. "She is my twin," he said. Max laughed. "Not in the least. "Thank you," said Olga guardedly. said Max. asked Olga. That's the sum complete of us." "We are a fairly respectable family nowadays," he observed, "thanks to Mordaunt who has a reputation to think of. She raised her arms with the careless, unstudied grace of a wild creature. "A matter of opinion," said Max. she said. "I don't anticipate any sudden development if I can keep her off that cursed opium. said Nick. questioned Nick. "He asked me to dine," said Max. Nick laughed. "Possibly in a fortnight. Nick nodded. "About Violetâ"practically nothing. "Ah, I know you are safe." "She was responsible from first to last. She knew of the taint in her veins. remarked Nick. Max rose abruptly. he asked bitterly. said Max. "Yes," he said, with his back turned, "I should." "No," said Nick. Max grunted. "Of course you are the exception to every rule." thrust in Nick. "It's been dinned into me ever since I met you." "I doâ"more or less." said Nick. said Nick. She is avoiding me like the plague." "Not in this case. "I have given her none." queried Nick. "Probably." Nick ruminated. "I?" "I'm not an utter brute, Ratcliffe," he said, "whatever I may appear." he asked. "She is a sensible little soul," contended Nick. "She may be. "I see," said Nick. "Absolutely." Yes, it's bound to come. It will probably come suddenly as a sequel to some shock or violent agitation. "About a month." "But you knew them before then?" said Nick. "Yes, really." "We are not officially engaged yetâ"or likely to be. "It is." If she heard his words she paid no heed to them, but broke at once into breathless speech. He put his arm about her shoulders as she withdrew the sheet and opened it out. "Yes, you can read it too. "I won't read any more, Nick. It's too private. She raised her head with the agitated gesture of one straining for self-control; and then in a moment the tears were running down her cheeks, and she covered her face and sobbed. remonstrated Nick. "Thank you," she said, with a quaint touch of dignity. said Max. "Yes, really!" she said. Nick chuckled. "He is pretending he doesn't mind, too, Olga." "Oh, Max never pretends," she said. grinned Nick. said Max. said Olga, as the door shut. enquired Nick. she said. "Perhaps he doesn't want you to get married," suggested Olga. "Apparently not. "I don't believe you ever mean to marry at all," said Olga. said Max briefly. "That gives me two hours and a half. she said then, lifting her bright face. He bent and lightly kissed her. Yes, you can leave the car here. "We will go to the shore first," Violet decreed. We must go and see it." So to the shore they went. said Violet. said Olga. said Olga. Men don't make love to me so much as they did." It's true." "It's quite true, Allegro. I am not so attractive as I was. "Of course we will! It will be too deliciousâ"the very thing I was longing for. "It's very good of you, but we can't possibly come. We must be getting back. "I don't see how we can possibly goâ"anyhow without telling Nick first. "Of course!" said Violet quickly. "None, I should say," smiled Hunt-Goring. asked Violet. For it seemed to her that she was a prisoner, looking her last upon the liberty of her youth. She was sure now that he had been supplying Violet with them secretly. "I don't know what you mean," she said, drawing sharply back. He laughed his smooth, easy laugh. she said. she thrust in fiercely. she demanded. She waited, compelling herself to silence. she said. he said. Then he let her go. "Yes," he said coolly, "I have been laying my mine for some time now. "I have loathed you ever since," she broke in. He laughed. "She is asleep," said Hunt-Goring. she cried. "Not to that extent. "Very well. "Simply this," said Hunt-Goring. That is so, I think?" She was silent, taken by surprise. "You!" she said. "You!" He laughed into her eyes of horror. That is the one extenuating circumstance of my villainy. She was still staring at him in open repulsion. she said breathlessly. "I love you, you see." I am well off. she cried vehemently. "I don't know what you mean by suggesting such a thing. I am not going to marry you, Major Hunt-Goring. "Thank you," said Hunt-Goring. Anyhow, let me try! "No," she told him flatly. he asked suavely. he insisted. She began to falter in spite of herself. "I smoke them myself constantly. No, those cigarettes are not responsible. "It's not possible! Naturally, all this has been kept from her. She knew beyond all doubting that it was true. she said at last. "No!" If she did not guess, she feared. "I have told you," he said, "that I mean to marry you, andâ"in keeping with the part of villain which you have assigned to meâ"I don't much care what I do to get you." she said. she cried out wildly. he said. he said. she panted. he said. he said. "No!" "No! No! No!" Abruptly he set her free. "Very well," he said. "Marry you I will. he said. "No, not thatâ"not that!" "Why not?" he insisted. "No, no! She was silent, but the quick blood ran to her temples betraying her. That is why you will have none of me, eh?" she cried vehemently. He laughed. That, we have seen, is only a figure of speech. "I beg your pardon?" she said again, and it was as if some inner force inspired the words. She was suddenly and overwhelmingly conscious of bodily weakness. Then, very suddenly he turned and left her. She was as one over whom a mighty wave had dashed. She realized it now. She knew she could not be very severe with him if he were really repentant. said Nick. he said. She obeyed him, as was her custom, leaning her head against him till gradually her breath came back to her and speech became possible. said Nick sharply. she said. she said. "Nick, I can't. "So he might," said Nick grimly. she said, catching at the word. She began to cry with her head against his arm. "Oh, damn!" said Nick to the world at large. "I couldn't help it, Nick," she said, still fast clinging to his hand. "I couldn't let her go alone." "Go on," said Nick. "Yes, Nick. he said, and for some reason Olga felt overwhelmingly foolish. he commanded. "He told her. she moaned. he pursued. Sheâ"she is in a terrible state, Nick. "We will go back to her in the motor," Nick said. he said. She was shivering as one with an ague, but she made desperate efforts to control herself. "It's no manner of use sending for him, Nick. "We will have him all the same," said Nick. "He is the man for the job." he said, as he got in beside her. "Oh, I am glad I've got you, Nick," she said. said Nick. "But that's my speciality." said Nick. "Certainly," said Nick. She peeped into the bar and found it empty. "No," said Nick. "I'm coming too." "Hi, Briggs! he said. "But, Nickâ"" said Olga in distress. "We will go down to the shore," he said. "Here, you Briggs! If she is not there, she is probably on the way." he said. Softly she turned the handle, only to discover that the door was locked. "I should wait if I were you," he counselled. "She is sure to want you later on." Olga glanced round for Nick, and found him at her side. She hesitated. he said. "Yes, Nick." said Mrs. Briggs. "Max, of course! Olga hesitated. she said at last. "Oh yes, but I am," she said. "I haven't much sanity left, Allegro. I can feel it slipping from me inch by inch like a paid-out rope. moaned Olga. I hardly ever cry. Men don't, you know. Olga urged her gently. "But then I was mad this morning," she said, "only I didn't know it. But I think my soul has gone on. "Of course I will help you, darling," Olga promised soothingly. "Yes. That's the worst of doctors. He's so clever. "I don't know. "He is just outside. But I won't have Max, Allegro. He is not to come near me. said Olga, gently bringing her back to the point. "Oh, if you like. We'll have some lunch, and then smoke." "No, dear. That's right. she said. "I promise, dearest!" "I love you, Allegro!" she said. She was waiting, she was listening, she was watching. For it was as though a hand were holding up a dim lantern on the other side to show her the dreadful scene, casting a stain of crimson across the space where once had stood the altar. he said. He nodded. she said. Yes, I know that story. "Oh, quite so," he said. "Just that," said Nick. "Plenty," said Nick. "Ah, I forgot! "When I had to," he said, with brevity. said Violet, and laughed. She was gazing at the open door. "No! No! No!" she cried. "Max, stop!" he said. Ah, here is Mrs. Briggs! She was shivering violently and moved spasmodically, as though the impulse to escape strongly urged her. "I promise," Olga said. he said. She hesitated, finding it somehow difficult to give an answer to his cool questioning. said Nick. "Yes, Nick." said Max. "Yes," said Olga. he asked then. "It's no good trying to keep anything from me," he observed. "Oh, Max!" he asked. Apparently there was not. said Nick. She was laughing still with white teeth gleaming, but in her eyes shone the glare of madness and the red, red lust of blood. "Nick! she cried, in an agony. "Here, child! "Nick! he said. "Only a flesh wound. asked Olga doubtfully. "Yes, if you get the pressure on the right place. That's the way! Nick did; and under his supervision the injury was bandaged at length with success. said Max approvingly. said Olga quickly. "Tell her to, Nick! "Yes. he said. Then he rose, and took up his coat. he said. said Nick. "Upstairs. "Oh, Max!" He turned to her. said Max; but he stood still, suffering her hand on his arm. "Yes, for her sake," she said. Oh, Max, really it is the only way. She knew well that where his patients were concerned he would endure no interference. "Very well," he said. "I have. "Not entirely." But Max was merciless. "I see," said Max. "She was annoyed because I didn't fulfil expectations by falling in love with her. "Yes," admitted Olga reluctantly. "I don't know quite how you managed it," he commented. he asked at last. Max glanced at him. "Yes, you will be quite useful no doubt. he said. "But you think she will get better?" she urged. she asked, still with the air of bringing herself painfully back as it were from a long distance. "I should say much worse." "I see." she asked him piteously. That is all that can be expected now." she cried passionately. "God knows," said Max. That's quite clear, is it?" "I quite understand," she said. he said. "I am counting on you." "And so you can, my son," he said. "She is the pluckiest kid I know." Very soon it would be dark. "Yes, dear." "Yes, dear." "It's very lovely up there, Allegro. I wanted to stay." "Yes. You were upset. she said. "No, no, dear!" "He is onlyâ"a littleâ"hurt. "I had to do it!" "He is so cruel. He keeps me back. "I'm not mad now," she whispered. I can feel it coming back. She was shivering violently now. "Perhaps they will do that. That's hell, isn't it? She raised an imploring face. She clung about her neck. she urged feverishly. she said, and fierce mother-love throbbed in her voice. Only she held her fast. And it was the truth. That's what I want you to save me from. "No." "Yes." "He won't come in here," Olga said steadfastly. she panted. "On guard," said Violet quickly. "Besides, you like Nick." "He was speaking of Death," said Olga, her voice very low. "Yes, yes! He said he wouldn't be afraid. "I don't know, darling." "Of course, the opening of the Door is to let us escape," ran on the feverish whisper. For it isn't dark up there, you know. "Not with you, my darling! Softly the door opened. "Go down to him, Mrs. Briggs," she said. Your hand is trembling." "Quite," said Violet. "No. She knew that even as she did so, her friend passed through â¦ Slowly she turned from the bed, as one in a dream, unconscious of tragedy, untouched by fear or agitation or any emotion whatsoever. "Yes, come in. he asked. "No, Nick; she has gone away." he said sharply. "So she would," said Nick. "I see," she said. said Nick. he said. "Yes, horribly cold, Nick," she answered. "I ought to do that," she said. she said. "She wanted to goâ"so dreadfully." "We are not big enough for that. It will do you good." She raised her two hands slowly, feeling as if they were weighted with iron fetters. "Nick!" "Here, darling!" came his prompt reply. "Nick!" she said again, in a voice of rising distress. She faced him, but even as she did so she was conscious of an awful coldness overwhelming her, as though at his touch her whole body had turned to ice. She knew that he did not need an answer. She raised her head with a desperate gesture. "I have opened the Door!" she said. "I have set her free!" She was hedged about by a fiery ring of sleeplessness that scorched her eyeballs whichever way she turned, giving her no rest. "Yes," he said grimly. "She will live," said Max curtly. She knew me just now." He said no word. Sharp as a ferret, Nick turned. she said incredulously. "Of course!" said Dr. Jim bluntly. "Oh, Dad, where have you been?" "I?" said Dr. Jim. "Why, here to be sure, for the past week. She obeyed him now. "But you won't go away again?" "Certainly not," he said, and took her hand into his own. She was like a little child in those days, conscious only of the passing moment, although even then at the back of her mind she was aware of a monstrous shadow that was never wholly absent day or night. "I wish he would come home, don't you?" he said, possessing himself of her wrist as usual. "I don't know," she said, knitting her brows. "But it's such a long while since he went away." "He was," said Dr. Jim. "But he has come back." she asked eagerly. he said. "Yes, he is staying at Redlands." she begged. she asked eagerly. "Yes, now," said Dr. Jim. he said, and though there seemed to be a laugh in his voice she fancied he was in some fashion more moved than she. she said. "It's nice of you not to set it down to advancing years," said Nick. "This morning," said Nick. she said again. she asked. "Oh, going strong," said Nick. said Nick. "Nick!" she said. "And it hurts me when I try. "It's nothing you need worry your head about, dear. "But that is not so," said Nick quickly and firmly. She clung to him delightedly. "Oh, Dad, isn't it fun? she asked him unexpectedly. "It's necessary sometimes," said Dr. Jim. said Olga. "He is splendid," said Reggie's mother, in the deep voice that always indicated depth of feeling also. said Olga in surprise. That is why we have to keep you so quiet." said Olga. "I don't suppose Dr. Jim would let him. But I told him I should." "I'll certainly try," said Olga. "No, dear. "Oh, Muriel!" "I should just think I am! "Oh, I will!" said Olga earnestly. Very little more passed between them on the subject then, but it filled Olga's mind throughout the day, even to the exclusion of that sinister shadow that still lurked at the back of her consciousness. Nick did not visit her until the evening, and then she at once began to talk of the topic that so occupied her thoughts. she said. "I'm so glad I've remembered. "Hear, hear!" said Nick, with a whoop of delight. she said quickly. he asked her, with keen eyes on her troubled face. "I don't know," she murmured wistfully. "Yes, you do. Come, tell me!" said Dr. Jim. So you call him Max, do you?" said Jim drily. "I couldn't help it," she faltered, hiding her face a little lower. "He made me." said Dr. Jim. "No!" "I couldn't at one time. said Dr. Jim. "I don't remember. he asked after a moment. She clung to him very fast. "And if you don't see him again?" said Dr. Jim. "Oh, Dad!" she said, with a deep breath. he persisted. she said, with immense relief. He gave her an abrupt kiss, and laid her down. "Very well then. That's settled," he said. She was beginning to be desperately afraid of the mystery she could not penetrate. She was not so well in the morning, and Dr. Jim rigidly refused to allow either Nick or Muriel at her bedside. said Nick. Yes, Olga would go to the glen. "Oh, ages!" said Nick. "Not to my knowledge," said Nick. "I do not," said Nick. she asked. He nodded towards a clump of ferns that fringed the bank. said Nick. "Oh, I wonder!" she said, in a voice of puzzled distress. he said cheerily. "I wish I knew," she said. "I've never seen more than one," said Nick, "so it would appear to be a more artful dodger than you took it for. "No, and I hope he isn't here. "Oh, but in a different way," protested Olga. Again his quick eyes flashed over her. "I?" said Olga. "Yes, you, my dear. "I'm not going to pursue the subject, but just this onceâ"in justice to the manâ"I must have my say. I like him thoroughly. she said, as one incredulous. "Yes, dear, I do," said Nick. Nick dined at his brother's house at Weir that evening, alone with Max Wyndham. Max grunted, and the silence was renewed. said Max. said Max. The laugh was more apparent now. "They did," said Nick. "Perhaps you haven't tried," said Nick. asked Max grimly. "It is," he answered; "a very strong recommendation." he said. "I'm going to," said Noel. "Oh, are you?" "It is, isn't it?" said Noel, with a large sigh. "Oh, Noel!" said Noel, who was twenty-two and a crack shot in the Regiment. said Noel. she asked seductively, casting an affectionate glance towards the empty plate. "Oh, rather!" said Noel. "Oh, Noel!" And, "Oh, Noel!" Noel set her down and rose. We must be going. "Noel and me, we're goin' to be married, we are." "So we are," said Noel. "I should say it depended a little on their respective ages," smiled Mrs. Musgrave. "Ah, I know," said Noel. "Not Mrs. Nick," she corrected him. "I wish it had been. She is my greatest friend. "I have it on unimpeachable authority." "Yes, she is his niece. I knew her as a child, a giddy little thingâ"rather like Nick himself." questioned Noel. She is quite a girl." ejaculated Noel. "Hear, hear!" said Noel. "Of course you are quite irresistible," said Mrs. Musgrave. "I couldn't resist him, Will. He asked himself." She was not in the drawing-room when the self-invited guest arrived, and it fell to her husband to receive and entertain him. "I had to beg jolly hard, I can tell you. Will laughed. "Oh, quite a giant in his own line." "Just as well. "I shouldn't say anything of that kind before Miss Ratcliffe," said Will. ejaculated Noel. "But it's just as well to be sure it is a karait before you take those measures, as there are more hopeful remedies for other species." said Noel. said Nick. said Nick. said Noel boyishly. Nick nodded. "Only once, Nick?" "Oh, my cricketing days are over. "Oh, Jupiter!" "Sound, is he?" said Nick. "I should say so; but fancy he's a bit fiery," said Will. That's what Mummy does." "It's no good now." "Oh, I say!" "It's in the Bible," asserted Peggy. "Yes, it is." "Your eyes are all laughy." Then we can have a cuddle." "Why not?" "No, I can't. he said. "But you must kneel down," she said. abundantly testified. she asked. "I shouldn't." said Noel. "No. Very likely you won't want to marry me when you're grown up," Noel explained. "No, I'm not. That's better than nothing, isn't it?" "Oh, but it's very wicked to kill people." "Oh, Noel!" he said. said Olga. I knew you were there." she said. he asked her, bowing deeply. "Very easily, I should say. "Of course she is," said Noel. "Hop in, infant! That's the way, mavourneen!" "Perhaps," said Olga. She was searching for her hostess's rings and spoke with a somewhat absent air. "I have that honour," said Noel drily. said Olga proudly. "He is a hero wherever he goes." asked Noel. She faced him. "No. asked Noel. "I envy you both," said Noel. asked Olga. "Oh, rather!" said Noel. Again he laughed. It did not seem to matter. She was not strong enough to go out very much, and beyond a few calls with Nick and a dinner or two at the cantonments she had not seen much of the social life of Sharapura. "Of course," she said. "I'm not absurdâ"on this occasion," returned Nick. "None, Nick." He nodded. She was listening with far-away eyes. he said. "Yes, really," he said. "Oh, but I did!"
