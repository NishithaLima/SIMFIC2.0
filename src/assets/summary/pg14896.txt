 He arose to summon Mr. Flitcroft from an adjoining room, then changed his mind long enough carefully to replace the diamond in the box and thrust the box into a pigeonhole of his desk. "Please ask Mr. Czenki to come here," Mr. Latham directed. "The cutting is very fine," the expert went on. "Approximately, I mean?" "Please get the exact weight," Mr. Latham requested abruptly. he asked at last. he queried impatiently, at last. "I haf. he inquired. "Show him der odder von." suggested Mr. Latham coldly. "Please be good enough to look at this, Mr. Czenki." "It's a diamond!" The others nodded unanimously. suggested Mr. Schultze. "Yes." The others nodded their approval of Mr. Czenki's opinion. It rests with you. "What is your proposition?" "What is your proposition?" he repeated. The others were silent, stunned, overcome. The others he swept off into it, then snapped the lock. "I'm sorry, gentlemen, if the terms seem hard, but I think, after consideration, you will agree that I have done you a favor by coming to you instead of going into the market and destroying it. That is all. "Now, Jimmy, get on the job," instructed Mr. Birnes, as he stepped in. He went through an elaborate pretense of paying Jimmy, the while he regarded Mr. Wynne, who had also alighted and was paying the driver. That was the question! He would see, would Mr. Birnes. Yes. No. No, Mr. Wynne didn't have a family. That was all. "Empty, did you say?" He arose abruptly, with the light of a great determination in his face. "If not, I'll see you to-morrow, here." He went out. "Yep." "Wrong, Cap," and the cabby grinned. "Yep. he asked. he inquired. "No." "No." I love you. he repeated thoughtfully. "Yah," Mr. Schultze agreed. "No," he said flatly. "No." "What is it, please?" "No," was the unhesitating response. "Yes, frequently. "Why, you astonish me," he remarked. "Never, no." Is it clear, sir?" "I beg your pardon," Mr. Czenki apologized. I beg your pardon," he added. He arose as if to go. "Show him in," directed Mr. Latham. "Go on." suggested Mr. Czenki. In all probability, by express. he repeated. "I beg your pardon," he said quietly. I beg your pardon," he concluded. "Where did you get them?" "Where did you find them?" He arose and went toward her. "Not to-day, no," he responded. "Gene, I can't stand it," she burst out passionately. He stared at her gravely for an instant, then turned, crumpled up the section of newspaper with its glaring head-lines and dropped it into a waste-basket. "I'm sorry," he said gently. Gene, I couldn't stand it. "It's absurd," and he attempted to laugh off her uneasiness. "He is all I have in the world now, Gene, except you. she insisted. she asked curiously. These men, or others from the same agency, are here all the time. "I'm sorry." "It's all for you and it will all be right," he assured her. "Gene, dear Gene!" she exclaimed hysterically. "No," he commanded harshly, and he, too, arose. "No." she flashed. "Give me long distanceâ"Coaldale, Numberâ"" "No," commanded Mr. Wynne, and he placed one hand over the transmitter tightly. she flamed. "Give me long distance, Coaldale Numberâ"" With a quick movement he snapped the connecting wire from the instrument, and the receiver was free in her hand. "We will find another way, dear." she asked tensely. "Not like this," he replied. I, too, am afraid now. Forgive me, dear." "Gene, Gene!" she exclaimed. "We will go now," said Mr. Wynne quietly. "But is it safe, Gene?" she asked quickly. "Perfectly safe, yes. asked the chief. "Where is that?" "And a thin face, naturally. he queried. he told himself. That was all. He started forward impulsively; the grip of Detective-Sergeant Connelly on his arm stopped him. he inquired. he continued. The proportion is wrong, you see. he asked. "Yes." "Yes." I am in business for myself, and make more than that. Now answer me a question, please. So, that was it! he repeated. "Give me 21845 River, New York. . . . Yes. . . . Is Mr. Latham there? . . . Yes, Henry Latham . . . ." He started forward, with gritting teeth, and simultaneously Chief Arkwright, Detective-Sergeant Connelly and Mr. Czenki laid restraining hands upon him. . . . . . . . . . . Yes. . . . Yes. . . . Oh, there were? . . Unexpected developments, yes. . . . . . . Yes. . . . "Where are they, Czenki?" "He makes them, man! He arose. He stared dumbly, first at Mr. Czenki, then at Mr. Schultze. And sat down. "If id iss, id iss. It has been done, Mr. Latham; it has been done! "He suggested it by his question," Mr. Czenki went on. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . "But they don't know," Mr. Czenki burst out fiercely. "I remember," the expert acquiesced grimly. That is all, I think."
