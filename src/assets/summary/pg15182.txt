 There are very few of the humbler class. he asked, for she had only said, "I want a ticket." she repeated. "She is evidently on the road for Colney Hatch," he observed. she asked. "No," replied a gentleman; "we have not reached Crewe yet. "Let me get out here," she said, and without a word he unlocked the door, and she left the carriage. asked the landlady, Mrs. Hirste. "No," replied the strange, weak voice. "I am alone," she saidâ""alone and safe. So she stood in all the splendor of her grand loveliness. "Let me die!" "You cannot be cruel. You cannot think it is wrong to meet me. He laughed. "No, sweet. He noticed it. "As a rule, Marion, you are quite right. You, sweet, are rich and beautiful. You are a true heroine. You are content 'to lose the world for love.'" I wish you would go to my guardian and tell him you love me. Indeed, she would not be angry." he asked. "Nothing would happen," she replied; "and they would be pleased to see me happy." "No," she replied, slowly. "No," she replied, "I could not, Allan. "Thank you," he said, gratefully, kissing the little white hand clasped in his. "I knew you would not be cruel, Marion. You are so heroic and grandâ"so unlike other girls; you would not darken my solitary life for an absurd scrupleâ"you would not refuse to see me, when the sight of you is the only sunbeam that cheers my life." "You will write to me, Marionâ"and, darling, my heart lives on your wordsâ"they are ever present with me. cried the young man. Miss Lyster was not long before she knew the rank and social importance of her beautiful young pupil. Her wish was gratified at last. "It is well worth your while to try," said his sister. he asked, looking admiringly into his sister's face. "You are a clever woman, Adelaide; with you to help me I cannot fail." "I cannot tell," replied Miss Arleigh, her beautiful young face flushing as she spoke. "He said, ah! asked the young lady, sadly. asked the girl, to whom this flattery was most sweet and pleasant. You are so noble in mind yourself, you do not even understand want of nobility in others. "No one could suspect your brother Allan of that." "No one who knows him. You do not know the power vested in the hands of the rich and mighty. "That is not fair," said the heiress, thoughtfully. She talked well, and the most subtle and clever of arguments came to her naturally. she asked of another governess. "I dare not tell youâ"I cannot tell you, Miss Arleigh. "Yes, it is about him. "He is all I have in the world," continued the governess; "the only gleam of light or love in my troubled life. I am in despair. The heiress bent over her. I am so sorry, Adelaide." My brother must die. If it is possible, I will do it." "I dare not mention it. "If you would but consent to see himâ"I know you will not, but it is the only means of saving himâ"if you expressed but the faintest shadow of a wish, he would stay; I know he would." "I knew you would not. My brother is a genius, not a lord." You make me wretched. She would have had friends and admirers, her love and affection would have found proper objects, and the great calamity of her life would have been averted. She could not remember, but she knew there were innumerable instances of queens having loved their subjectsâ"to wit, the stately Elizabeth and Essex. Miss Lyster's stare of admiration was something wonderful to see. Miss Lyster managed her so skilfully that before it took place she had learned to long for it. asked the girl. I wish to see you.' You can excuse yourself from going. "I cannot tell an untruth," she said to Miss Lyster; "I could not if I tried. "By all means, stay at home, my love, if you wish, and Miss Lyster, too. Miss Lyster had chosen her time well. he said. Miss Lyster laughed. "I think, Allan," she said, "that I shall leave you to listen to Miss Arleigh's lecture alone. "You are so good to me," murmured the young artist, his dark eyes flashing keenly for one-half a minute over that beautiful face. "I am at a loss for words." "I am glad to see you," she said. he asked eagerly. "You are so good to me," he continued, with passionate eagerness, "that I am not afraid to tell you. "You are a great lady," he said, "rich, noble, powerful. I am a poor artist. "You are an angel!" he cried. How dearly he loved her, and how strange it was! "It is no wonder," replied Allan Lyster. You do well, lady, in making me remember myself." "Yet it is not very terrible, Mr. Lyster. "It is a serious thing to interfere with a man's life." You are not angry?" Ah, lady! "I believe it," she replied. "You see me at the lessons," she said. "Pardon me, I do not. I am an artist, practiced to admire. He would fain have lingered by her side talking to her, looking in her lovely face, but prudence told him that he had said enough. "I hope Allan has made no blunder," thought the sister; aloud she said, "I know it. We must go, Marion; it is time to re-enter the house." asked the girl. She laughed and held it out to him. "Thank you," he said; "now that you have touched it it ought not to die." "Do all artists talk like you, Mr. He laughed to himself to think how easy the task was; so easy, in fact, that he felt a touch of contempt for that which was so easily won. "If I succeed, painting may go. "She deserves it. He could not marry her without the consent of her guardian, and to ask for it was, of course, nonsense. He would bind her to himself with the most solemn of promises, and the very day she was of age they would be married. "He is very handsome and very clever," was the grave reply. "Marion, he worships youâ"his love is something that frightens me." "He is a poet and artist both," said his sister, with a little touch of pride that amused the heiress. But if you have her own word pledged to you, her promise of marriage written so that there shall be no mistake, then it will be worth a fortune to you." "If she fulfils it, all well and good. But if she refuses to keep it, the remedy then is in your own hands." Ah, you should find out what I loved you for, sweet. She promised to be Allan Lyster's wife. I can give you no title." "You can give me what I value more," she said. "You can give me true and disinterested love." "Grant me a favor," he said. No doubts ever came to her. "You will like Hanton," she said. "It is old, gray and picturesque; the woods are beautiful, there is a river running through them." "At Christmas, I expect. "I hope so," he replied. "You do not know where you will live?" "No, that is not decided. "It is my belief," said Miss Lyster, "that if he could change his whole heart into one great ruby, he would do so, and offer it to you." We must have her home at once." she asked her husband; and to do him justice, he looked much confused. "I hardly know what to answer you, Laura. "I think so. "A beauty, and a wealthy heiress! We must have her at home at once, William. "You do not know the social importance of your ward," she said. She may be a duchess if she likes." "She has been a docile pupil, and she is a beautiful, lovable girl. said Lady Ridsdale. "I should imagine that my guardian did not know what to do with me," she replied, with a smile so bright and sweet that Lord Ridsdale at once fell in love with her, as his wife had done before him. "I suppose not," was the smiling reply. "You wish, of course, to make her a very handsome present?" "I am quite sure to do that," she said; "but I made the promise. said Lady Ridsdale, kindly. "Let me see her; ask her to come here, and I will speak to her. Now, Miss Lyster was not wanting in good sense. Miss Lyster's reply was a deep, silent bow. Miss Lyster, after a few more words, quitted the room. she asked simply. "You will not forget me, darling?" he said, pleadingly. "You will write to me, and you will let me sometimes see you?" She promised faithfully. Here all was refinement, grace, courtesy and kindness. So she wrote a letter full of commonplaces, and when Allan Lyster read it he bit his lips in fierce, hot anger. "She is learning not to care for me already," he said. "She has never written so coldly to me before." You need not be anxious; there is no possible plea on which she can escape you now. Allan took her advice. My lady smiled suavely, and made no reply. Miss Lyster was all enthusiasm, and she was tolerably well acquainted with the first principles of art. he asked. "No," she replied. "You are so kind, Lord Ridsdale, that I may tell you of what I was thinking. "You are too kind, Lord Ridsdale. "Then by all means. Miss Lyster, write and ask him. She would have liked above all things to have trusted and confided in her. "He is not true," she said. He could not, contrive as he would, obtain five minutes with her. "It is really wonderful." "I cannot bear anything clandestine or underhand beneath their roof." A reply that, strange to say, silenced Miss Lyster. "He is not a gentleman," she said. "I am quite right, my dear," she said. She would never be false to them; all her life long she would do her best to advance Allan's interest; but she must release herself from the tie that became unbearable to her. She talked to him about his pictures, and the progress he was making. But she could see plainly if that visit was to be renewed she must go, and make no sign. I loved you, so I forgot prudence, ceremony, etiquette, and all. She could not bear the burden of the secret any longer, neither could she possibly fulfil the contract. "It seems to me," he said, "that there is an end of the whole businessâ"a dead failure." "Nothing of the kind," she replied. "She has done so," he replied. "Take my advice, Allan. You cannot marry her now, she will never be willing, but you can make a very decent fortune out of her when she is married." he asked. "It seems so very bad," he said. "Not at all. She would not even miss a thousand a year and see what one thousand alone would do for you." But she dare not tell him. So she committed that greatest of all errors, she engaged herself to marry Lord Atherton without telling him of her acquaintance with the young artist. "You will be able to get what you like from her, Allan. Those letters will be worth a fortune, after all. You are married, Marion! You, who promised so faithfully to be my wife. You, whose letters to me contain that promise given over and over again. "Marion, I must have compensation. She could fancy the papers, their paragraphs, their remarks, their comments. She could almost see the heading: "Action for Breach of Promise against Lady Atherton." He would leave her, she was sure. He would find some means of saving her, she was quite sure of that. So she sent the thousand pounds, and then there was an interval of peace. He laughed. "Marion," he said, "it seems absurd to say, but, my darling, you are positively shabbyâ"that is, for one in your position. Her face flushed, and Lord Atherton smiled. She could not tell him that she had sent that all away, and had not a shilling left. "If you persist in your refusal," he wrote, "I shall go at once to Lord Atherton. She weighed it well in her mind. She could not bring disgrace on her husband and live. She could not doom her only child to sorrow and shame, yet live. She could not bear the ignominy of the exposure. She could not bear it. No, she dare not. "I cannot live and I dare not die," she moaned. "I am utterly wretched, utterly hopeless and miserable. She would not kill herself. Notwithstanding all these comforts, Allan Lyster was not happy. "I cannot think," he said to himself, "why she does not send." "That is the messenger," he said to himself, triumphantly, "and it is quite time, too." he cried, in a voice of thunderâ""those letters that you have, holding as a sword over the head of my wife!" replied Allan. Now bring them here." "I am not accustomed, my lord, to this treatment." "She did not always think so," was the sullen reply. "If you had not stepped in and robbed me, she would have been my wife now." "You cannot," said Allan Lyster. "I can. "You see, Lord Atherton, she did promise to marry me, and I did reckon upon her fortune. "Nothing. "It is as I thought," he said, when he came to the last. "It is the worst case of fraud, deception and cowardice I have ever met. Allan took it sullenly enough. "That is as it may be," said Lord Atherton, quietly. I know that you cannot brand yourself with deeper disgrace and shame than by making public your share in this transaction." "Now," he continued, blandly, "I am going to give you a lesson. "I should not like to touch even a dog with it," he said, "after it has touched you." he cried. "It is my wife," he said, quietly. "Thank God, I have found her." he said to himself. "Marion," he said, gently. "My sweet wife," he said, "do not be afraid. I know all about it, darling. You need fear no more." she asked. "Yes, I know all about it. she asked, after a short pause. has been removed.
