 In this obscurity nothing was to be heard but the fall of quiet feet, nothing to be seen but silent shades visible against the twilight like shapes of deeper darkness. Was She not, above all, the living and thrice Blessed Mother? This was years ago. At the present day few persons climb to La Salette but the natives of DauphinÃ©, tourists wandering through the Alps, or invalids following the cure at the neighbouring mineral springs of La Mothe. thought Durtal, calling up the memories of a journey he had made with the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin and his housekeeper, since leaving La Trappe. thought he. "It is hideous," thought Durtal. thought he, "they may well be proud of the pilgrims who venture to those desolate regions to pray where the vision actually appeared, for when once they are there they are packed on a little plot of ground no bigger than the Place Saint Sulpice, hemmed in on one side by a church of rough stone daubed with cement of the colour of Valbonnais mustard, and on the other by a graveyard. In two words, to sum up the scene, it was nature's scab, the leprosy of the earth. "From the artistic point of view, on this microscopic grand parade, close to the spring whose waters are caught in pipes with taps, three bronze statues stand in different spots. "Years went by. "This avowed testimony to such amazing facts was enough to give a fresh impetus to the masses. "Oh, yes! "Why, above all, have created La Salette and then sacrificed it, as it were? "On the other hand, She appeared there with a special and very definite end in view: to preach repentance to mankind, and especially to priests. She would thus seem less attractive to the vulgar who do not love woe or weeping; it may be added that they still less love reproof and threats. "She was, in short, in that sanctuary, the Virgin of the world at large, not the Virgin of mystics and artists, the Virgin of the few, as at La Salette. thought Durtal. Indeed, She effects more moral than physical cures. None can understand, and probably none will ever know. "As we gaze into the darkness, two spots of light appear," he replied to himself. "There is not indeed a single case where the shepherd maids who saw Her described Her otherwise than as a 'beautiful lady' with the features of the Virgin of a village altar, a Madonna of the Saint-Sulpice shops, a street-corner Queen. He keeps in the background, giving precedence to His Mother. "Yes, it was but just that the Virgin should cherish them and choose them above all others to be Her vessels of election. "Yes. Her head, wrapped in a blue kerchief, was set in a golden glory, and she stared out, hieratic and wild-looking, with white, wide-open eyes. And here again, under the immemorial name of Notre Dame de la belle VerriÃ¨re, she held an infant in a dress of raisin-purple, a child barely visible in the mixture of dark hues all about it. In short, She to whom all appealed was there; everywhere under the forest roof of this cathedral the Virgin was present. Only, in the present day, such memories of heroic times were vain. In this city of Chartres, where Saint Bernard preached the second crusade, the vessel was stranded for ever, her hull overset, her anchor out. Sometimes, however, in a rebellious mood he managed to check himself, to stop the ill-regulated clockwork of his prayers, and then he would try to examine himself, to get above himself, and to see in a comprehensive glance the puzzling perspective of his nature. And yet these ghosts of departed crimes were no more than indefinite shapes; they never consolidated nor took a definite form. How worm-eaten, how arid were the poor recesses of his soul! What is quite certain is that, though she is not in the least like the AbbÃ©, she too is in two halvesâ"two persons in one. "Never." our friend, you see I am in disgrace up there!" I was a negress. "But you must have been very dull travelling about alone?" "Never. Heaven, as a punishment, deprived me of the Communion for a year and three months to a day. He tried to mollify the prelate by his advanced age, but the Bishop would not listen; all he would concede was that, instead of being appointed Vicar-general, the AbbÃ© should be no more than a Canon. "I do not deny itâ"but there are other things on the quays besides old books; there are curiosities to be seen, and the Seineâ"a landscapeâ"" "Well, if you are homesick for that particular walk, you have only to take a train, and spend a whole afternoon lounging by the parapet over the river; it is easy to get from Chartres to Paris; there are express trains morning and evening which make the journey in less than two hours." you will live near Her, with Her, and She will load you with mercies!" "Oh, oh!" "But you cannot know much about it, since you have never been to the place." said the AbbÃ©, laughing. "It is a fact," Durtal admitted when he was alone, "a positive fact that the capital is unprofitable to me. In some dioceses these lapsed benefices are compensated for by the revenues from some religious foundation, or, as you may call it, a prebend. Each one, in short, has a struggle to earn his food and lodging." It is lost in the night of ages. It is supposed that Colleges of Canons existed in the time of PÃ©pin le Bref; it is at any rate certain that during his reign Saint Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz, assembled the clerks of his cathedral and obliged them to live together, in a house in common, as though it were a convent, under a rule of which Charlemagne makes mention in his Capitularies.â"A Canon's functions? As it has not Episcopal Orders, it can exercise none of the powers inherent in them. In short, as you see, a Canon is not a very important gentleman. Then he went on,â" "To return to my subjectâ"I was naturally somewhat hurt by the coldness I met with on my arrival at Chartres. As I told you, I had to allay many apprehensions. "No." What is he like?" "Again, it must be clearly stated that the pointed equilateral arch, which some persons still suppose to be the distinctive characteristic of an era in architecture, is not so in fact, as Quicherat has very clearly demonstrated, and, since him, Lecoy de la Marche. "Each and all seemed to smile, as soon as they gave up their dismal skeleton and strove upwards. to think of the tears, the dolorous murmurs of those thick partitions, those smoky vaults, those arches resting on squat pillars, those almost speechless blocks of stone, those sober ornaments expressing their symbolism so curtly! At least, to me, that is the interpretation of these styles," Durtal repeated to himself. "The parallel, when you consider it, is exact. Some, austere at their birth, are cheerful and even smiling as they are completed. thought he, thus led to an unforeseen conclusion. "To be sure, it is not necessary perhaps that the church itself should offer so complete a parallel, or that the Old and New Testaments should be bound up in one volume; here, indeed, at Chartres the work, though integral, is in two separate volumes, since the crypt on which the Gothic church rests is Romanesque. It is you, Madame Bavoil?" "To be sure. I am going home from market, and from your lodgings." "Yes, to invite you to breakfast. "Yes, and in spite of it all, I am glad to have her." A copper ring swung in the wind at the end of a bell-rope, knocking the chipped plaster of the wall. "How sad to see an old man, a victim to rheumatism, housed here!" thought Durtal. "Come to the fire," said the AbbÃ©, "for in spite of the brazier it is fearfully cold." "But at any rate Monseigneur might have stoves put into the rooms, here and there." cried the AbbÃ©, laughing, "but he has no private means whatever. In this rich, but irreligious town he can hope for no assistance; the gardener and porter are paid by him; he is obliged for economy's sake to employ Sisters from a convent as cook and linen-keeper. Why, he is poorer than you or I!" Bishop, canons, priests, everybody here is poverty-stricken." He looked even more scared than usual; he bowed, backing away, and did not know what to do with his hands, which he buried in his sleeves. "It is the fifth erection over a Druidical cave," said the AbbÃ© Plomb. This was blasted by lightning in 1194; nothing remained but the two belfries and the crypt. The flames were, however kept within limits, and the church was refitted. "Finally, on the 4th of June, 1836, a tremendous fire broke out, caused by the carelessness of two plumbers working under the roof. "Yes, and what is still more strange," said the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin, "Is the persistency of fire from heaven, bent on destroying it." asked Durtal. "Do you know," said Durtal, "that this grotto is prefigured in the Old Testament by a human structure of almost official character? "No, thank you." "Why?" "Dear me," said Durtal, "by way of high feeding I can improve on that. "Yes." "As are those of almost all the builders of great churches," replied the AbbÃ© Plomb. "Their work was finished at the beginning of the sixteenth century by Jehan Le Texier, known as Jehan de Beauce, who erected the northern belfry, called the New Belfry, and the decorative work inside the church, forming the niches for the groups on the walls of the choir-aisles or ambulatory." Was he the architect, the sculptor, the donor of this porchâ"or the butcher? None can say. said the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin, "and they were Canons who thought fit to break two ancient windows in the choir and fill them with white panes, the better to light that group of Bridan's!" "Yes, and I believe them to be correct. "What do you mean by the word?" said the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. "But here, too, the soul is absent. "It is the same with the Cathedral of Laonâ"bare, ice-bound, dead past hope; while some are in an intermediate state, dying, but not yet cold: Reims, Rouen, Dijon, Tours, and Le Mans for instance; even in these there is some refreshment; and Bourges, with its five porches opening on a long perspective of aisles, and its vast deserted spaces; or Beauvais, a melancholy fragment, having no more than a head and arms flung out in despair like an appeal for ever ignored by Heaven, have still preserved some of the aroma of olden days. Whereas in our Cathedral She receives you at once, just as She is. "And what in your opinion constitutes the soul of Chartres?" asked the AbbÃ© Plomb. "No, its vitality comes from the Sisterhoods, the peasant women, the pious schools, the pupils of the Seminary, and perhaps more especially from the children of the choir, who crowd to kiss the Pillar and kneel before the Black Virgin. "How is that?" "It is the same with the mystic writers. They too are Spanish, Italian, German, Flemishâ"not one is French." "I beg your pardon, our friend!" Then he went home, meditating, as he walked, on this strange division of art in the middle ages, and the supremacy given to France in architecture, when as yet she was so inferior in every other art. They are not even able to pilfer skilfully from their precursors. This was the famous Virgin of the Cavern, or rather a copy of it, for the original was burnt in 1793 in front of the great porch of the Cathedral, amid the delirious raving of sans-culottes. The boy on his knees, his soul aspiring and his hands clasped, spoke aloud and slowly, rehearsing the responses of the Psalm with such deep attention and respect, that the meaning of this noble liturgy, which has ceased to amaze us, because we are so used to hearing it stammered out in hot haste, was suddenly revealed to Durtal. This was all he had to offer to the Father in expiation of his contumely and refractoriness, his errors and his falls. thought he, "how could I dare to pour out the ready-made collects of which the prayer-books are full, how say to God, while addressing Him as 'Lovely Jesus,' that He is the beloved of my heart, that I solemnly vow never to love anything but Him, that I would die rather than ever displease Him? "No," said Durtal, "apart from the personal outpourings, the secret intimacy in which we are bold to tell Him everything that comes into our head, the prayers of the liturgy alone can be uttered with impunity by any man, for it is the peculiarity of these inspirations that they adapt themselves in all ages to every state of the mind and every phase of life. to think that things are always the same, always going back to the beginning! For, after all, it is all very well for the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin to insist that I should communicate, he is not Iâ"he is not in me; he does not know the wild doings in my hidden lairs, or the turmoil in my ruins. He believes it to be mere nervelessness, indolence. His powers were benumbed, his faculties arrested. In Paris, at the core of his soul, which seemed rolled up in itself like a chrysalis, there had always been a sort of restraint, an awkwardness in waiting, and in approaching Christ, and then an apathy which nothing could shake off. And you felt that even beyond the horizon they still stretched away as flat as ever; only the monotony of the landscape was emphasized by the raging fury of the tempestuous winds, sweeping the hillside, levelling the tree-tops, and wreaking themselves on this basilica, which, perched on high, had for centuries defied their efforts. I should like to see them try. and Anne de Bretagne; then FranÃ§ois I., Henri III. "It is some consolation to me that you perceive it," said the AbbÃ©, smiling. It is like a thing arranged on purpose; as soon as I try to shut the cage all my thoughts fly offâ"they deafen me with their chirping." Well, shall I tell you the truth? "No. "But if I have nothing to say to Her?" Oh, these men! If you can invent nothing on your own part, borrow from another. Well, is that pretty well expressed, our friend? Such little ways are permitted by Her, and we must be humble enough not to presume to do without them." "You want me to become a trickster, a sneak in spiritual life!" No, of course not." "Thank you. Why, am I not a peasant? In short, she suggested the absurd idea of a solemn, gawky Marlborough disguised as a cook. The rain fell in uninterrupted streams, unwinding endless skeins of water. "The AbbÃ© will certainly not turn out in such weather." Their ink at once turned to stickiness, to bird-lime, to pitch, which smeared all it touched. Oh, the poor Saints! He threw himself back in an arm-chair, tucking his hands into his cincture. "No doubt, and I am well aware that devotion does not always sweeten the mind, butâ" "The truth is," said he after reflection, "that the assiduous practice of religion generally results in some intense effects on the soul. Do not you think, Monsieur l'AbbÃ©, that these youths occupy their bodies just enough for suffering and to expiate the sins of others? "I do not knowâ"I knew nothing of the origin of these ladsâ"but I feel that you are right. "Though our boys are not unique, they are no doubt rare. "Oh, the rain will not cease," said Durtal. "There is no hurry. "But it can be done?" "Undoubtedly. "And of course the period when human beings lived in closest intercourse with Godâ"the Middle Agesâ"was certain to follow the revealed tradition of Christ, and express itself in symbolical language, especially in speaking of that Spirit, that essence, that incomprehensible and nameless Being who to us is God. At the same time it had at its command a practical means of making itself understood. "Yes, it did that too. "This sufficiently accounts for the cruciform plan of our churches. "It is a certain fact," the AbbÃ© went on, "that the position of the towers was never rigidly laid down once for all in mediÃ¦val times; thus different interpretations are admissible according to their position in the structure. "And likewise of Noah's Arkâ"the Ark outside which there is no safety," added the AbbÃ©. "Again, these blocks of stone of various shapes are bound and held together by mortar, of which Durand of Mende will tell you the meaning. asked Durtal. The baptismal pool was in this porch. "Such, briefly, is the allegorical meaning of the parts. The door, thus divided, typifies the two roads which man is free to follow. Indeed, in most cathedrals this symbol is emphasized by a representation of the Last Judgment placed above the entrance. "They no doubt typify the seven avenues, the seven gifts of the Paraclete. Saint Isidor of Seville, and Saint Augustine studied it. Thus a pillar by itself may not necessarily typify an Apostle, but if there should be twelve, they evidently show the meaning attributed to them by the builder, since they recall the exact number of Christ's disciples. Sometimes, indeed, to prevent any mistake, the answer is supplied with the problem; as in an old church at Ãtampes, where I read, inscribed on the twelve Romanesque shafts, the names of the Apostles in relief, in the traditional setting of a Greek cross. Three is the number of the Persons of the Trinity, and of the theological virtues. As with the value of coins in the Middle Ages, we know nothing about them. In short, it is the principle of the Trinity, the primary Three, applied to every part." "Do you know," said he, "the theories of Honorius of Autun as to the symbolism of the censer?" "No." "It is the very madness of Symbolism!" cried Durtal. "Or, again, take the substances used by the Church in certain ceremonies: water, wine, ashes, salt, oil, balsam, incense. They are mingled to sign the altar with the cross, and to sprinkle the aisles: the water and wine symbolize the two natures united in Our Lord; the salt is divine wisdom; the ashes are in memory of His Passion. "It is certainly mystical, and far more appropriate than the vessels of every form, the ciboria of silver-gilt, of aluminum, of silver of these days." "Come all the same. "But it is a biography that is not easy to deal with or that can be lightly handled," said Durtal to himself, as he arranged the notes he had collected by degrees as bearing on this Venerable woman. In short, the Order of the Incarnate Word was born rickety and died a dwarf. It lingered in the midst of universal apathy, and survived till 1790, when it was buried. "There is no doubt of it," Durtal concluded; "we are far enough from the strong sap which Saint Theresa and Saint Clare could infuse into the centennial growth of their mighty trees! "Now, what is the reason? Why, new foundations are set on foot and flourish every day! Is it, then, the austerity of the rule? "If God grants me life, no doubt I shall one day do this; but the plan is not yet ripe. He gave her comfort, and announced to her her vocation as a Carmelite. Then obstacles arose, the work of the Devil. There she fell at the feet of Mother Anne, who blessed her, and raised her up cured. Then her novitiate began. And her daughters adored her, wept to see her lead a life which now was one long torment. Her health grew worse and worse. "How such women as these carry one away and throw one, as it were! 'The Early Painters, and Prayer in Colour as seen in their Works.' "It is quite true," thought he, "the towers vary like the basilicas. They are as speaking, as much alive, as those in Paris are stern and mute. They are of different heights, lame against the sky; another that is really magnificent in its solitude, and putting to shame the mediocrity of the two belfries lately erected on each side of the west front, is the Norman tower of Saint Ouen, its summit encircled by a crown. It always rises heavily, pants on the way, and falls asleep exhausted. We must wait till the end of the fifteenth, when France drew breath, to see architecture start into life once more. "But if you are willing, we will be off at once, for I am afraid of being caught here if I linger." At the same time Durand of Mende, in his Rationale, asserts that a building of rounded form symbolizes the extension of the Church over the whole circle of the universe. Sometimes, indeedâ"but this statement needs verificationâ"the architect had substituted for the body of the Saviour that of the Saint in whose name the church was dedicated, and the curved axis of Saint Savin, for instance, has been supposed to represent the bend of the wheel which was the instrument of that Saint's martyrdom. "Now, to look at home once more, we will consider the inward parts of our sanctuaries. "There is, however, a different explanation given by Richard de Saint Victor, as to the sanctuary, the choir, and the nave. "Now behind this altar we find the apse, assuming in most cathedrals the form of a semicircle. "This semicircular end, this apsidal shell, with the chapels that surround the choir, simulates the Crown of Thorns on the Head of Christ. This was the Mother of a Christ of the North, the Christ of a Pre-Raphaelite Flemish painter. said the AbbÃ© as he pointed to the nave. That cathedral, it is true, was bent on outstripping its sisters. "Springing into the air at one flight, when it reached the upper spaces it tottered and fell. "Yes, Monsieur l'AbbÃ©; and that sanctuary and that apse, so narrow and restricted, with columns so close together, and the iridescent light, like filmy soap bubbles, from walls which seem made of glass, disturb and bewilder you; on first entering it gives the impression of indescribable uneasiness, a sort of anxious and distressed anticipation. They are like the smooth muscular trunks of beech trees, which have also the angular edges of reeds. It is almost certain that the arcades of the forest were the starting-point for the mystic avenues of our aisles. And again, look at the pillars. Here, again, everything is in threes. So, you see, Notre Dame is full of the Trinity." "Yes, and like other Gothic cathedrals, it is the completest and most trustworthy collection of symbolism; for the allegories we fancy we can interpret in Romanesque churches are on the whole but artificial and doubtfulâ"and that is quite conceivable. "Now, what is the very special character of the mysticism of the East? Nothing of the kind, no amorous addresses, no trepidations, no laments. "On the whole," the priest concluded, as he shook hands with Durtal at his own door, "it is the symbol of the inner life, the image of the monastic life; in a word, the true architecture of the cloister." Well, nearly 18,000," said the AbbÃ© Plomb. Ah, no! "You do not!" "Your satire is scathing," replied the AbbÃ©. "But as to the general sin of greediness, they hardly admit that they are guilty of it. They are sealed against every generous idea, regarding the intercourse they hold with the Redeemer as beseeming their rank and in good style; but they never seek to know Him more nearly, and restrict themselves, of deliberate purpose, to calls of politeness." "No, at Easter," corrected Madame Bavoil. "Not being able to go to a cafÃ© like a man, they go to church," said Durtal. "And of railway stations," added the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. Read it to us." At the very bottom of the picture a splash of gorgeous redâ"the Magdalen's robeâ"that finds an echo in the flame-colour of one of the steps of the throne, and reappears here and there, but softened in fragmentary glimpses of drapery, or smothered under a running pattern of gold as in St. Augustine's cope serves as a spring-board, as it were, to start the whole stupendous harmony. They are too, for the most part, common and ugly to a degree that is most puzzling. These are in the main the only colours used by Angelico. His palette, as may be seen, is very limited. What is certainly far less easy to explain is the limited variety of countenance the painter has chosen to adopt. Here symbolism is of no use. Look, for instance, at the men. At least, so they appear at a first glance. They are of matchless purity, of a more than human innocence in their blue and rose-pink and green robes sprigged with gold, with their yellow or red hair, at once aerial and heavy, their chastely downcast eyes, and flesh as white as pith. He carries his angels and his saints up to the Unifying Life, the supreme height of Mysticism. The types chosen for the Apostles and Saints are, as we have said, quite ordinary. Each is looking into himself. Jesus dwells in them, and they can gaze on Him better in their inmost heart than on His throne. They are drowned in adoration, and spring buoyant, though motionless, to meet the Heavenly Spouse. They are placed there, in the august assumption of gold and the chaste ascending scale of blue, to lead by a stair of pure joy to the sublime platform whereon we see the group of the Saviour and the Virgin. And here, in the presence of the Mother and Son, the ecstatic painter overflows. Her age is indeterminate; She is not a woman, yet She is no longer a child. She remains incomparable, unapproached in painting. If we consider it, this soul is that of a female saint rather than of a monk. He is a Sister rather than a Friar-artist; and it is from this loving sensibility, which in the mystic vocation is more generally peculiar to women, that he has drawn the pathetic orisons and tender lamentation of his works. "Your article is very good," said the AbbÃ© Plomb. "Precisely. "On the left-hand shutter, the Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Penance are shown, in small detached scenes; and on the right-hand shutter those of Ordination, Marriage and Extreme Unction. "This picture, a work of marvellous beauty, with the 'Descent from the Cross' by Quentin Matsys, are the inestimable glory of the Belgium gallery; but I will not linger over a full description of this work; I will omit any reflection suggested by the supreme art of the painter, and restrict myself to recording that part of the work which bears on the symbolism of colour." "It is impossible to doubt it, for he has assigned a different hue to each Sacrament, by introducing above the scenes he depicts, an angel whose robe is in each instance different in accordance with the ceremony set forth. "On the whole, I find only white and blue which never change." "And why this neglect?" "I do not know, any more than I know why so many colours formerly used in our services have been forgotten. "It was the idea of the spiritual dawn rising on the night of the soul, a special impression which violet, now used on those days, could not give." "Yes, it is to be regretted that blue and rose-colour have disappeared from the Churches of the West," said the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. "Obviously," replied Durtal, "green denoting freshness of feeling, the essence of good, hope; and orange, in its better meaning, being regarded as representing the act by which God unites Himself to man, we might conclude from these data that Saint Agnes had attained the life of union, the possession of the Saviour, by virtue of her innocence and the fervour of her aspirations. She would thus be the image of virtue yearning and fulfilled, of hope rewarded, in short. asked the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. cried Durtal. At the present day those painters who attempt religious subjects are ignorant of the first elements of the symbolism of colours, just as modern architects are ignorant of the first principles of mystical theology as embodied in buildings." "No doubt," said Durtal, "but the symbolism of gems is much confused. They form a series of synonyms, each replacing the other with scarcely a shade of difference. "Obviously; and as I warned you, the analogies are very far-fetched. "Yes, and the symbolist goldsmiths wrought diadems, setting them with precious stones, to crown Our Lady's brow; but their poems showed little variety, for they were all borrowed from the Libellus Corona Virginis, an apocryphal work ascribed to St. Ildefonso, and formerly famous in convents." "This prayer in minerals opens with a human greeting. Accept this ring in pledge of that betrothal, O Mary!' "Finally the donor points out to the Virgin the interpretation of certain other matters set in the ring, which in the Middle Ages were regarded as precious: crystal, emblematic of chastity of body and soul; ligurite, resembling amber, more especially figurative of the quality of temperance; lodestone, which attracts iron, as She touches the chords of repentant hearts with the bow of her loving-kindness. Amen.'" "Or, again, if we borrow from Pope Innocent III. asked Durtal. "And all this time you are forgetting the meaning of other well-known gems," cried Madame Bavoil. "The ruby, the garnet, the aqua-marine; are they speechless?" "No," replied Durtal. "The ruby speaks of tranquility and patience; the garnet, Innocent III. tells us, symbolizes charity. There yet remain two gems, the turquoise and the opal. "Why is that?" And, in fact, in the Middle Ages they were highly esteemed and used to effect cures." Some of the buildings claimed their attention, as, for instance, the House of Detention, in the Rue-Sainte-ThÃ©rÃ¨se near the Palais de Justice. "There you see," said the AbbÃ©, "behind the embankment of the Western Railway stands the Convent of the Sisters of Our Lady and of the Carmelites; here, nearer to the town on this side of the line, are the Little Sisters of the Poor." Then Chartres was exhausted, and paused for breath. This was an arch of triumph, and under this the Brethren of the Christian Schools were to escort the canopy. At the head of the procession, behind the gaudy uniforms of the ponderous beadles, came the girls of the Congregational Schools, dressed in crude blue with white veils, in two ranks, filling up the roadway; then followed delegates of nuns from every Order that has a House in the diocese; Sisters of the Visitation from Dreux, Ladies of the Sacred Heart from ChÃ¢teaudun, Sisters of the Immaculate Conception from Nogent le Rotrou, the uncloistered Sisters of the Cloistered Orders of Chartres, Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul and Poor Clares, whose dresses of blueish grey and peat-brown contrasted with the black robes of the others. This was all. cried Durtal to himself. The priesthood, eager for bed, had shut up shop. "I am simply bored to death," said he to himself, "and why?" "Bored by myselfâ"ah, yes, most heartily! How tired I am of watching myself, of trying to detect the secret of my disgust and contentiousness. "No, no," he went on presently. The saints may, no doubt; but even they suffer under it! It is so natural to entreat God for a little joy, to look forward to an Union consummated by a loving word, a signâ"a mere nothing that may show that He is present. "Say what they may, we cannot help being pained by a dead absorption of that living bread! "In short, whatever the reason, I am no better off at Chartres than in Paris," was his conclusion. In Paris, in old days, he at any rate got through the hours at the services. "Why regret Parisâ"why, indeed?" he would ask himself. In short, he had deluded himself when he had fancied that a man might make a cell of a solitary room in silent surroundings; the religious jog-trot in a provincial atmosphere had no resemblance to the life of a monastery. "The idea of the cloister haunts you," said he. "No, indeed, not that, at any rate. It is a mere half-measure. "Be a Benedictine Father or oblate, a black Friar. "I do not sayâ"butâ"" "But what?" "Ah, ha!" Your trouble is neither in the air nor outside you, but within you. Nothing can be more false. "But, Father, he must at any rate be comforted." "Dryness of spirit and the dreams to which it gives rise are not the sign of a vocation," said he. Give me my hat, Madame Bavoil. By speaking of an Order that existed, mentioning it by name and actually specifying a House under its rule, the AbbÃ© had given Durtal substantial food instead of the argumentative wordiness of a mania; he had afforded him something better to chew than the empty air on which he had fed so long. Every craving of the soul was described, every misery of the body foreseen. Then how merciful, how wise it was when addressing itself to the feeble and infirm. "Now, the subjects represented on the royal front and in the south porch are identical. At the same time, when the subjects do not entirely coincide on the front and back of the page, they are often complementary, or carry out the same idea. "In short, it is the ruling idea of the poem which governs all these differences and harmonies; which comes out like a refrain after each of these three strophes in stone; the idea that this church belongs to Our Mother. It is a vast encyclopÃ¦dia of mediÃ¦val learning as concerning God, the Virgin, and the Elect. "There is only one difficulty. Indeed, it might be said that these are the very figures he overlooks; and, in the same way, he takes no account of the western doors, which he could not force into his scheme. "This archÃ¦ologist's ideas, in fact, cannot be maintained. It is likewise the first chapter of the book, and it sums up the whole of the building. "In building this, the twelfth century did more. And Anna brings forth Mary, whom they dedicate to the Lord. "Years then pass, till the time comes when the Virgin is to be betrothed. "On the left we see the Ascension of Our Lord, soaring triumphant on clouds rendered by a waving scroll held on each side, in the Byzantine manner, by two angels; while below, the Apostles with uplifted faces, gaze at this ascension pointed out to them by other angels who have descended and hover over them, their fingers extended towards the sky. "Finally, in the middle, the great doorway illustrates the subject round which the storied carving of the other doors all centres: the Glorification of Our Lord, as Saint John beheld it at Patmos; the Apocalypse, the last book of the Bible, spread open on the forefront of the basilica, above the grand entrance to the church. With one hand He blesses the world; in the other He holds the Book with the seven Seals. "From the point of view of artistic execution the work in the grand subject is crisp and splendid; the smaller figures are obscure and mutilated. "Nowhere, indeed, in mediÃ¦val sculpture does the Redeemer appear as more saddened or more pitiful, or under a more solemn aspect. What is the meaning of these enigmas? The body is swathed, and rigid, in a large cloak with wide sleeves, and the richly-jewelled sheath of a gown that betrays no feminine outline of figure. Is she living the life of Union with God beyond the worlds, where time is no more? But other princesses have been canonized, and, like her, hold books. At the same time, the monastic aspect of this queen, her emaciated figure, her eye vaguely fixed on the region of internal dreams, would well befit Clotaire's wife, who retired to a cloister. "Her face is wilful and alert, and rather haughty. "It is very certain that this Elect lady was not always a pattern of amiabilityâ"not what could be called easy to get on with. She would be Clotilde before her repentanceâ"the Queen, before she became a saint. And why, if her name is not in the Book of Life, has she a glory? "It is highly probable that she is neither the wife of Clovis, nor Solomon's friendâ"this strange princess who stands before us, at once so earthly and yet more spectral than her sisters; for time has marred her features, injured her skin, dotted her chin with hail-specks, vulgarized her mouth, injured her nose, making it look like the ace of clubs, and put the stamp of death on that living countenance. The bodice is richly trimmed and stitched; below her waist hangs a cord with loose jewelled knots; on her head is a crown. Both arms are broken; one hand rested on her bosom; in the other she held a sceptre, of which a small portion remains. "This queen is smiling, artless, and engagingâ"quite charming. None may know. They worked humbly, anonymously. To raise this glorious temple, purity was required even of the workmen. This was a crusade, if ever there was one. Nothingâ"neither sloughs, nor bogs, nor pathless forests, nor fordless rivers, could check the advancing tide of the marching throng; and one morning, from every point of the compass, lo! Nothing was ever more simply or more efficiently organized; the convent cellarers, forming a sort of commissariat for this army, superintended the distribution of food, and saw to the sanitation of the huts and the health of the camp. These again were under the orders of the wonderful man, the nameless genius, who, after conceiving the plan of this cathedral, directed the whole work. This the pilgrims accept, and, feeling less weary, they go on their way. Of this all drink, and it heals the sick. "I am going on at once, they are waiting for me," said the priest. The boy nodded an affirmative, and showed Durtal into a waiting-room. "As you see." "What do you think of the monastery?" What is it that you want to know, exactly?" "Why, everything you can tell me." If Notre Dame des Arts had a special sanctuary, it undoubtedly would be there." But, then, where is decent glass to be had?" "Nowhere. We have only to look at the transparent pictures let into the walls of our new churches to appreciate the incurable idiocy of painters who insist on treating window panes from cartoons, as they do subject picturesâ"and such subjects! "It is glorious. "Yes, she it is. "Why, she is one of the great Abbesses of the Middle Ages," cried Durtal. "Yes, and even this does not hinder some persons from regarding convents as the homes of idleness and reservoirs of folly. "It is necessary not only to understand the language of the Psalms as they are sung, but to appreciate meanings which are often doubtful in the Vulgate, in order to express them properly. Thus a true Benedictine must be at once a saint, a learned man, and an artist." "And what is the daily life of Solesmes?" asked Durtal. As you see, there is time for meditation and work in the intervals between the canonical hours and meals." said the AbbÃ©, laughing. Now, I am sorry to observe that your favourites are for the most part of evil augury." "I do not understand you, Monsieur l'AbbÃ©." Lentils, for instanceâ"you grow lentils?" "Yes." So plant whole fields of garlic, Madame Bavoil." His housekeeper, quite scared, stood looking at the ground. "I have a less medical, and more religious, idea: cultivate a liturgical garden and emblematic vegetables; make a kitchen and flower garden that may set forth the glory of God and carry up our prayers in their language; and, in short, imitate the purpose of the Song of the Three Holy Children in the fiery furnace, when they called on all Nature, from the breath of the storm to the seed buried in the field, to Bless the Lord!" Indeed, as a rule, the image-makers selected native plants characteristic of the region where they were employed." "I do not think so," said the AbbÃ©. Otherwise we might assert that this later ornament has a different tale to tell from that set forth in the flora of Reims and Amiens, Rouen and Chartres. "No doubt. "It is true that as a remedy against the dejection caused by myrrh we may apply the 'hymelsloszel' HimmelschlÃ¼ssel , which isâ"or appears to beâ"Primula officinalis, the cowslip, whose bunches of fragrant yellow blossoms are to be seen in moist woods and meadows. This plant is 'warm,' and imbibes its qualities from the light. "I do not know," said the AbbÃ© Plomb. In short, what you need is a sort of language of flowers as applied to the catechism. "For pride we have the pumpkin, which was worshipped of old as a divinity in Sicyon. "I beg your pardon," said the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin; "Saint Eucher and Raban Maur speak of thorns as emblematical of riches which accumulate to the detriment of the soul; and Saint Melito says that the sycamore means greed of money." cried the younger priest. "Carnivorous plants, perhaps, as the fly-trap and the bog sundew." "And why not the humbler cuscuta, the dodder, the cuttlefish of the vegetable kingdom, which shoots out the antennÃ¦ of its stems as fine as thread, attaching itself to other plants by tiny suckers and feeding greedily on their juices?" asked the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. "And likewise, according to Saint Melito, of the Confessors; or, according to Saint Mechtildis, of widows," added the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. "How is that to be done?" asked the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. "It is certainly the fact," observed Durtal, "that the innocence of the lily is far from obvious, for its scent, when you think of it, is anything rather than chaste. It is a mingling of honey and pepper, at once acrid and mawkish, pallid but piercing; it is suggestive rather of the aphrodisiac conserves of the East and the erotic sweetmeats of the Indies." "Again, turn to Peter Cantor. It is simple enough." "It is complicated enough!" "And also mignonette," cried Durtal, "for Sister Emmerich speaks of it frequently and with much mystery. our friend is not so ignorant of country lore as I had fancied," exclaimed Madame Bavoil. "Oh, I wandered in the woods a little, as a child." "That was practically a paraphrase of Isaiah's prophetic verse: 'I have trodden the wine-press alone, and there was no man with me'; but the mystic mill is, I own, unknown to me." "I have seen it once at Berne, in a window of the fifteenth century," said the AbbÃ© Plomb. "I also saw it in the cathedral at Erfurt, painted, not on glass, but on a panel. "Here," said Durtal, pointing with his stick to the side aisles as traced in the sand. "Now, to represent the side chapels we have a choice. One we shall dedicate, of course, to Saint John the Baptist. In this, no doubt, we may see an allusion to the thorns which Bishops were not always unready to thrust on the long-suffering Heads of monasteries. "And even so, our cathedral remains incomplete. We are but feeling our way, without logical sequence. And yet, to be sure, Saint John has the sun-flower, signifying divine inspiration; for he is represented in a window in the church of Saint RÃ©my at Reims, his head crowned with a nimbus surmounted by two of these flowers." "Nay, do not think it hopeless," cried the AbbÃ© Plomb. She died in 1824." "What does that matter?" To me they are of equal authority with those of Saint Mechtildis, who was born in the early part of the thirteenth century. "I quite agree." "And all this time," said the housekeeper, "you do not think of making use in your building of the iris, which my good Jeanne de Matel regards as an emblem of peace." "That will not be difficult," replied the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. "From the grain of mustard seed, which all the symbolists accept in a figurative sense as representing Christ, to the sycamore and the terebinth, you have a wide range; you can at pleasure have a tiny cross, a mere nothing, or a gigantic crucifix." "Here," Durtal went on, "along the bays where trefoils flourish, different flowers rise from the ground, corresponding to the saints of their ascription; here is the chapel of Our Lady of the Seven Dolours, recognizable by the passion-flower full blown on its creeping stem, with its many tendrils; and the background is a hedge of reeds and rhamnus, full of sad meaning, mitigated by the compassionate myrtle. "But after all, you are absurd, our friend!" "Yes, indeed!" "There I am in my element; I do not lose my footing as I do in your imitation churches." "It is near breakfast time." "Because of all saints he is the most neglected, the least invoked by those of our contemporaries who ought to be most assiduous; since he is regarded in the attributions of special virtues as the patron saint of idiots." cried the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. "And who is not likely to find any," said Durtal, as he left them. murmured Durtal, laying down the book. Why was this? Indeed, the contrary ought to be the truth. For, after all, this was the great theory of the Middle Ages, the theological method in sculpture, the literary dogma of the monks of that time; and this is the meaning and purpose of certain groups which even now shock the propriety of our methodistical purists. And yet it would have been so easy to explain the purpose of these scenes; far from seeking to apologize for the tolerance of the Church that allowed them, her honesty and breadth should have been held up to admiration. This was part of her plan of education, for she aimed at moulding manly souls and not crippled creatures such as are turned out by the spiritual orthopedists of our day; she dragged out vice and lashed it wherever it lurked, and did not hesitate to preach the equality of men before God, insisting that bishops and monks should, when guilty, be placed in the pillory of its doorways; nay, she gibbeted them more willingly than others, to set an example. We have only to open the books of the Church to convince ourselves of the violent language in which she was wont to lash the sins of the flesh. By speaking thus, I hope to fill you with horror of the turpitude you commit." "It is very true! "Here," said he to himself, "we reach the climax; pious imbecility can go no further. "The indecency of God, the obscenity of a new-born Babe is too much! "The time has slipped away in all this meditation, and the AbbÃ© will be waiting." Otherwise Chartres, unlike her sister cathedrals, would have no scenes of that kind." "Yes. cried Durtal, "the greatest blunder ever introduced into the symbolism of the elements. "There are diabolical effluvia in the storm, and in weather when the air stirs like the vapours from a furnace, rousing evil instincts and bringing about us the raging swarm of evil angels." asked the AbbÃ© Plomb. "I do not love them. "This portal, brought forward like an open porch, a sort of verandah in front of the doors, is an allegory of the Saviour showing the way into the heavenly Jerusalem. "It forms, in fact, three deep bays or gulfs. "There is a third interpretation," said Durtal, "but it is ridiculous. That of Didron, who regards this front as the first page of the Book of Chartres. cried Durtal. "No doubt. "Why is this?" "No doubt because the Emperor Beaudouin, after the sack of Constantinople, bestowed that Saint's head on this cathedral. His place is not there, but in the Gospels." "Finally, in addition to this series of patriarchs and prophets, you may see there, in the hollow between the pilasters, a pair of statues, one on each side of the door: Elijah the Tishbite, and Elisha his disciple. "Argument is vain," murmured Durtal, who was meditative. "No doubt; for, after all, and it cannot be too often repeated, the Old Testament is the story before the event of the Son of Man and the founding of His Church; as Saint Augustine bears witness, 'the whole history of the Jewish people was a perpetual prophecy of the expected King.' "But it is when they speak of His Passion and Death that the prophecies become mathematically exact, incredibly precise. asked Durtal. "Some have asserted that he was Shem, the son of Noah; others have thought that he was Ham. "She tells us nothing precise," replied Durtal. "From the artist's point of view," Durtal went on, "Melchizedec is one of the best statues in this porch. And do you remember the Simeon, the Virgin, and the St. Anne at Reims? The mouth is puckered in sorrow, and promises tears. He is apart from the conventional and hackneyed type. He is a butcher pricing his goods, weighing the meat, inviting you to feel it, and hesitating to sell till he gets the best price. "The tympanum of the door will have no charm for us," the AbbÃ© went on. "It is much mutilated, in a lamentable state of ruin. "On the right is seen the contemplative life; a woman praying, holding a closed book, opening it, reading it; she shuts it to meditate on it, teaches others, and falls into an ecstasy. "Finally, in the outermost hollow of the moulding of the arch, the nearest to us and the most visible, there are fourteen statues of queens, leaning on shields with coats-of-arms, and formerly holding banners. Prouder souls, and humbler." It has suffered less, and may be explained in a few words. "This sculptured vault is, as you know, dedicated to types of Mary; but we might more accurately say that it is devoted to prototypes of Christ, for in this doorway, as in the other two, indeed, the image-makers of the thirteenth century have made it their task to identity the Son with the Mother." Whole books, as the Song of Songs and the Book of Wisdom, allude in every verse to Her beauty and wisdom. "On the left Balaam, the Queen of Sheba and Solomon. "On the right, Jesus the son of Sirach, Judith or Esther, and Joseph." "The tympanum, as you see, is divided into two portions. "Why?" "Yes; that is true, no doubt." Then came Elijah, cursing the worship of Baal, contending with the dreadful Jezebel; Elijah founding the first society of monks, the only man of the Old Testament history except Enoch who did not die; and Elisha, his disciple; the greater prophets Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel, and the groups of minor prophets announcing the advent of the Son, rising up in commination or lamentation, threatening or comforting the people. After ablution and the anointing with oil, the holocaust of victims began. In this strange hot-bed, filled with clumps of flowers and of women, this immense harem where his seven hundred princesses and his three hundred concubines disported themselves, Solomon watched the whirl of dances, gazed at the living hedge of women, seen against the background of gold-plated walls, their bodies clothed only in the transparent veil of vapour rising from resins burning on tripods. In advance of the ideas of his time, he was the great builder in Israel, and the commerce of the country was of his making. After his death, too, the old king remains a mystery. Was he, like his fathers, received into Abraham's bosom? "Finally, there is the question of health. Why, it was the only logical existence, the only right life! In short, was not the company of the Brethren far superior to that of men of any profession, condition, or sort, whom he would be obliged to meet in the world outside? "It is the only life desirable," cried he. "It is settled!" This floored him. Then he tried to fight against it, and lost patience. "Come, come!" "And all this is so human, so vile! It is a case of subjection without reserve, of leaping boldly into the water; of giving oneself up entirely to God. Any other view of the cloister is to regard it as a citizen's home, and that is absurd. Do not desert me; finish Thy work. What is easy to some is so hard for others. Mine is a restless spirit, always astir, always on the alert. to be no longer thus torn in sunder, to be of one mind! Blessed Virgin, I do not seek to excuse myself and my sins. But no. Then he went on,â" "I am wrong to address Thee thus," he said. An altar stood in the middle of this well, dedicated in the name of Saint Lubin. Will you come with me, our friend?" The path led upwards, cut into steps. He looked about him, surprised at seeing nobody, hearing nothing; but Madame Bavoil beckoned to him, made her way round the house, and led the way into a sort of vestibule along which clambered a vine wrapped in swathing, and she turned into a little chapel, where she knelt down on the flagstones. This was held up by fat little angels, the swollen infants of the sculptors of that period, and floating in the air was a scroll bearing the motto of the order: "Zelo, zelatus sum, pro Domino Deo Exercituum." thought Durtal. He knelt down on a chair, and by degrees his impressions underwent a change. A sense of warmth of soul stole over him, of being at home in this solitude. "It is stupendous!" he went on. said Madame Bavoil, tapping him on the shoulder. "And what must the nuns think as they hear these continual departures for the outer world? "And I cannot help thinking of the appearance as of a reservoir that the style of building gives to this Carmel. "But it is a curious case, nevertheless." "No," she answered, sadly. I am deaf and blind. If He detects a trace of vanity in the soul on which He shines, He departs. In short, His will be done!â"And you, our friend, do you still think of taking shelter in a cloister?" "Because, no doubt, you are not honest in your dealings. He tried to brush away these distractions, and went on: "Despise not the prayers we put up to Thee in our needsâ"" And he was off again at a gallop in his dreamsâ""Even supposing that no difficulty were made about this request, the question would still remain as to submitting manuscripts for revision, obtaining the imprimatur; and how would that be arranged?" Jesus, whose expression was the only interesting feature of the picture, a certain manly gravity that was shown without any disfigurement of the character of childhood, was also round and well-fed, and the scene took place on a lawn strewn with flowersâ"primroses, violets, and strawberries painted in fine stipple with the touch of a miniaturist. In short, this Virgin was neither human nor divine; she had not even the too realistic touch of Lochner, and could, no more than the other, have been the chosen Mother of God. They are the very converse of every other school; for everywhere else, in Italy, Flanders, Holland, Burgundy, pictures began by being clumsy and unfinished, barbarous and hard, but at least ardent and pious! "This school may be thus summed up," said Durtal. "It is the triumph of padding and puffing, the apotheosis of fatness and sheen, and this has nothing to do with Christian art in the true sense of the word. We must turn to the less familiar schools of Franconia and Swabia; there we find the very opposite. As art it is savage and rough, but it livesâ"it weeps, nay it cries aloud, but it prays. We must look at the works of these unkempt geniuses, such as GrÃ¼newald, whose Christs, rebellious and wrathful, grind their teeth; or Zeitblom, whose 'Veronica's veil,' in the Berlin Museum, is unpleasant, no doubt; the angels have black leather crosses on their breasts, and the Saviour's head is terrible, horrible; still there is such energy in the work, such decision, such crudity, that the very sincerity of its ugliness is impressive. thought Durtal, closing his notes of travel. The countenance is the same, fretful and weary; it is evident that the same model sat for both. They are both purely pagan. They are Ganymedes, borrowed from mythology, not from the Bible. Ay, that Nativity!â"He had only to turn to his notes to see it plainly before him. We must leap into Holland to find the mystic accent once more, and it reveals itself in the soul of a Judaizing Protestant, under an aspect so mysterious and eccentric that at first sight we hesitate, feeling ourselves, as it were, to make sure that we are not mistaken in regarding this as religious art. Pull the work to pieces; it ought to seem dull, monotonous, voiceless. It is a meal of humble folk in a prison; the colours are limited to a key of sad greys and browns, excepting in the case of the man who twists his napkin, whose sleeves are thick with a vermilion like red sealing-wax, while the others might be painted with dust and pitch. These are the literal facts; but they are not the truth, for everything is transfigured. In our own time, again, there is nothing to note. At the present moment Signol is dead, but Olivier Merson is left; vacuity all along the line. We need not take into account the got-up absurdities and paintings to puzzle Rosicrucian simpletons; nor, again, the feeble imagery of the wealthy idlers or the worthy youths who fancy that if they paint a woman larger than life, that makes her mystical. Some of these compositions were all but laughable, that of the Ninth Station, to mention one: Christ lying at full length on His face, and being pulled up by a rope tied to His bound hands; it looked as if He were learning to swim. The system was bound to end in ankylosis, in the paralysis of painting, and this, in fact, was the result. At the entrance to the chapel of the Augustine Sisters in that town, of which Borel had painted the nave and the choir, there stood a figure of an Abbess of the fourteenth century, Saint Clare of Montefalcone, in the black robes of an Augustinian Nun, against the stone walls of her cell, an open book on one side of the figure and a brass lamp on the other, somewhat behind her on a table. This was the most remarkable religious painting of our time, and it was achieved with no borrowing from the Early painters, no trickery of awkward attitudes supported by iron bars, no affectations, no artifice. After him the rest was silence. "There is no denying it," said he; "this artist has the instinct, the subtle sense of aerial space, of expanse; he understands the soul of calm waters flowing under a vast sky! I should have to work up my notes, and after dealing with Meister Wilhelm, Stephan Lochner, and Zeitblom, to speak of Bernhardt Strigel, an almost unknown painter, of Albert DÃ¼rer, Holbein, Martin Schongauer, Hans Balding, Burgkmayer, and I know not how many more. I should have to account for whatever may have survived of orthodoxy in Germany after the Reformation; to mention, at any rate, from the Lutheran point of view, that extraordinary painter, Cranach, whose Adams are bearded Apollos of the complexion of a Red Indian, and his Eves slender, chubby-faced courtesans, with bullet heads, little shrimps' eyes, lips moulded out of red pomatum, breasts like apples close under the neck, long, slim legs, elegantly formed, with the calf high up, and large, flat feet with thick ankles. It is amusing to dream over, but not to write. I should do better to seek a less panoramic, a compacter subject. sighed Durtal. 'But, alas! With one hand he held on his hat, and with the other grasped the skirts of his coat, which flapped about his legs. "And why have their successors so long lost it, as well as their red? And yet, what a glowing blue of pure, bold sapphire tone the artists of the furnace had at their command, and what a fine red they used, the colour of fresh blood! "This plan of substituting glass for bas-reliefs had its disadvantages; seen from outsideâ"their wrong sideâ"these diaphanous pictures look like spiders' nets on an enormous scale and thick with dust. In short, man fashions the form, prepares the body, and must wait till God infuses the soul. "It is to-day a high-day of light and the Sun of Justice is visiting His Mother," he went on, as he walked to where the pillared thicket of the choir ended at the south transept, to look at the window known as Notre Dame de la belle VerriÃ¨re, the figure, in blue, relieved against a mingled background of dead-leaf olive, brown, iris violet, plum-green; She gazed out with her sad and pensive poutâ"a pout very cleverly restored by a modern glass-painter; and Durtal remembered that people had come to pray to Her, as he now went to pray to the Virgin of the Pillar and Notre Dame de Sous Terre. all such hopes are vain. In this Mary was sewing at baby-clothes while reading, and Saint Joseph, asleep in a chair, his head resting on his hand, was instructed in a dream of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin. "It is endurableâ"if it must beâ"in the Sainte-Chapelle, because it is very small, an oratory, a shrine; it might even be intelligible in that wonderful church at Brou, which is a boudoir; its vaulting and pendants are in polychrome and gold, and the ground has been paved with enamelled tiles, of which visible traces remain round the tombs. "It was emblematic of the soul of the sixteenth century, already devoid of reserve; the sanctuary, too brightly lighted, was secularized; we here see it fully blown, and it never folded up or veiled itself again. "Hah, it is you, Madame Bavoil." "Yes, our friend, I myself. And you, are you packing your trunks?" "Why, are not you going off to a convent?" said she, laughing. A cloud dimmed her eyes, and she looked down. "Envy no one, our friend," said she, "for each has his own struggles and griefs." "No, no," he said, "the service of the Lord is not all roses. No, holiness on earth is no child's play, life is not amusement. And yetâ"and yet if we consider, the darkness about us is not absolutely impenetrable, there is light in places and we can discern some truths, such as this: "God treats us as He treats plants. "And I may add," said Durtal to himself as he smiled on Madame Mesurat, who opened the door in answer to his ring, "Grant me, Lord, the grace not to be too much irritated by the buzzing of this great fly, the inexhaustible flow of this good woman's tongue!" sighed Durtal. We must find some other symbolism, closer and clearer. "To Bruno of Asti the dove is also an image of patience, a figure of the prophets. He is in fact the lion who seeks whom he may devour, the lion who rushes on his victim. "It is the same with the eagle, which Hugh of Saint Victor calls the standard of Pride. The lion, emblematical of Omnipotence, is also the apt allegory of the Resurrection. Thus Christ, rising at the end of three days, escapes from the tomb at the call of His Father. They fly through the air, which is darkened by the disgorging of their stench and venom ... It is symbolical of dissimulation and depravity, and taken to typify the degrading life of the mountebank. "It is a very cruel beast, with a great and thick body after the fashion of a horse; it hath for a weapon a great horn, half a fathom in length, so sharp and so hard that there is nothing it cannot pierce.... "There must be some more fabulous beasts to be included," murmured Durtal, again turning over his papers. "But," said Durtal to himself, "that seems to me enough of the matter. He took out his watch. The ox, the lamb, the sheep, we have seen. We need not dwell on the bull, the bison and the buffalo; the symbolists regard them as emblems of brute force and pride; while the goat and boar-pig are vessels of lust and filth. "Yes, the Carmelites are accustomed to burn none but genuine true incense. "It is everywhere adulterated, I suppose?" "Yes. "And what have you there?" "Their meaning is known to you. We have, however, but little information on the subject. "Yes, and Saint Lydwine, when so ill, diffused a fragrance which also imparted a flavour. "On the other hand," the AbbÃ© went on, "the stench of wizards and witches was notorious in the Middle Ages. "She was persecuted by the devil from her infancy. "It was dashed to pieces, with a noise, said the saint, like an old shoe. "She was covered with filth indeed, but all was changed. "It is astounding, certainly; but is this the only instance of such infernal filth?" "There are certain essences mentioned in the Old Testament prefiguring the Virgin. Some of them are interpreted in other senses, as spikenard, cassia, and cinnamon. "How is that, Monsieur l'AbbÃ©?" God showed him that this phenomenon was of infernal origin, and it then ceased. "And I recollect a singular anecdote told by Quercetanus concerning a mistress of Charlemagne's who died. The body was examined, and in its mouth a ring was found, which was removed. "Yes." "I have, ere now, looked through many of these works, and they contain no information that can be of use from the point of view of symbolism. They are mere fabulous descriptions of animals, legends as to their origin and habits. "You don't get the like at La Trappe, our friend, eh?" said Madame Bavoil. "Yes, Monsieur l'AbbÃ©." "I have made a list for you from the works of Fillion and of LesÃªtre of the blunders made by the translators of the Bible when they disguised real beasts under chimerical names," said the AbbÃ© Plomb. "There was never any mythological fauna in the Sacred Books. As to Leviathan, it was a huge reptile, a gigantic python." he inquired, as he tasted a curious stew of greens. "Do you like the dish, our friend?" "Obviously, and with very little trouble. "Yes, and she alone is never spoken of as having any evil significance." our friend, you should hear what Mother Jeanne de Matel says of her." "What does she say, Madame Bavoil?" "This prefiguration of the Word by Noah is certainly curious," remarked Durtal. "Animals are also introduced in the iconography of the saints," the AbbÃ© Plomb resumed. Then, seeing Durtal's amazement, he smiled. He tried to struggle, to reason, to recover his self-possession; but the very effort was fatal. he cried. "Why, what is the matter?" cried the two priests. "I beg your pardon. Nothing." "No, it is nothing." "And I cannot help wondering why you should hesitate, for you will be welcomed with open arms. The Father Abbot is a man of the highest merit, and, moreover, no enemy to art. "The saints themselves are not free from distractions," replied the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin. And yet no, not so very childish," he suddenly told himself. "In that caseâ"well, well, so much the better! If I go down into it, I find everything dark and cold and empty. "How silly this all is; how much simpler it would be to allow myself to live, and, above all, to be led!" "I have hit it," he went on after a moment's reflection. In short, I was melting away, in a state of langour, more painful perhaps than this state of drought which is toughening me to horniness. In this frame of mind, half stay-at-home, half gipsy-like, if I take up a book of the higher mysticismâ"Saint Theresa or Saint Angelaâ"that subtle touch gains definiteness, I am aware of shocks running through me; I fancy that my soul is convalescent, that it is young again, and breathes once more; but if I try to take advantage of this lucid moment to collect myself and to pray, it is all overâ"I flee from myselfâ"nothing will work. What misery, and how pitiable! "The AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin has guided me so far, but how? But, if I am not mistaken, he is now turning his batteries. For, after all, there is something not quite above board in this affair. "I have only to hear and obey. Some doubt it. We are not told. None knows. "It is supposed that his name was Bartholomew. Sometimes, as at Amiens, he holds a palm, or, as at Chartres, a book. He is also seen with a cross, a square, a boat, a wand, an axe, a sword, and a spear. "That, indeed, is, I think, the most wonderful of all," said Durtal to himself. He lay calm, praying while he was being toasted. He remained unmoved, grilling and praying. In this assembly of famous saints he was rather the poor country-cousin, a mere provincial Saint. This was also devoted to two miracle workers, to a correspondence in this respect of the north and the south. In some cases his effigy was found on a gigantic scale, inside the church. Some indeed were reputed specialists, and the ills they cured were known by their names. In most of the churches I found only a colourless ceremonial, a meagre form of service. "Yes. "For religious dancing once existed," Durtal went on. "In ancient times it was a recognized offering of adoration, a tithe of light-heartedness. We need mention it merely as noteworthy, and that is all. "Now, from a practical point of view, what has the influence of symbolism been on souls?" Whichever way man could turn, he still saw Him. In short, this method of analogies was a bidding to everybody to watch and pray better. Then came the Renaissance, and symbolism was wrecked at the same time as church architecture. sighed Durtal. He looked at his cathedral, loving it better than ever now that he was to part from it for a few days.
