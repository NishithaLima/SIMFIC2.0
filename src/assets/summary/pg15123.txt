 Ask her mother, who married at fifteen. says Lockwin, half to himself. asks Lockwin. "Worry." His suit is bold. asks Lockwin. "Well, if ever I have seen two men whose destinies are hostile, it seems to me that you and Harpwood fill the condition. "Well, you are an odd man. it has been done. Now, are you not?" "No. "Tell me," she says, "of your little boy." "Yes, I love to hear you speak of him." "Well, Esther, the truest thing I have heard of my boy was said by old Richard Tarbelle. He stopped me the other day. 'Mr. "O, beautiful! Mr. Of course, I had to take a house and keep a number of people for whom a bachelor has no great need. "He is the most beautiful child I have ever seen anywhere. You are so proud of him when you ride together!" "He is as bright as he is beautiful," she says. "He is not yours, David." "I have as good a right to love him as you have. He is lonesome while I am gone!" It will require $100, as the union is mostly democratic. See you again. Good-bye." Here is the candidate. "Well, you ought to know whether or not you want to go. Nobody wants you there if it isn't yourself. "Yes, I suppose so." "Well, if you want our support, we must have a pledge from you. Say the word. "All right. "No. "Very well; we will carry the primaries. But that district needs watching. Bacon has missed it. Darwin avoids it. Running a faro bank. He was disheartened--tired of the business. "That's what I expect. "Well, my father got there. "That's a bird, too," says the political boss. Come down and see the boys. The house is reached. Politics, at least, has spared him the humiliation of moving on Prairie Avenue. Politics has kept him "among the people." The boy was not a step on the way to Congress! "Josephus," wrote curly-head; "Groceries," he added; "Ice," he concluded; A, B, C, D and so on, with a tail the wrong way on J. Here, Davy, here's papa. Oh, God, I'm so scared!" "That's 'Josephus,' papa, on your big book, that I'll have some day--it I live. The house-keeper said it was the worst possible thing to do. "Yes, you can, Davy. Papa's here. Lie down, Davy. It was too far. The specialist made the eyes a little worse. The housekeeper could say as much for a relative whom the cheap druggist had served. He was gratified to be called to the relief of a person of so much consequence. "Yes, you must get strong. It was a dream. "Yes, I see that. "Here, Davy. "You are very kind, Mr. Tarbelle." Here, Davy, you can carry an orange, too. Well, Mary will be waiting for me. Your servant, madam. Good day. Good day, madam. Yes, Mary, yes, yes. Good-bye, Davy. Good-bye, madam." The room has been hot, but by what chance does the furnace fail at such a moment? It is David Lockwin up and down, all night--now going to bed in hope the child will sleep--now rising in terror to hear that shrill breathing--now rousing all hands to heat the house and start a fire at the mantel. Read that. Ah, here it is. As for medicine, he will not take it. "Go to the head-quarters, David," she says. "You are needed. Pa says so. "He is much worse. "He has taken no medicine at all," says Esther. "It was spilled." He rinses his mouth with water, not daring to ask if the worst is coming. Yes, that medicine--ipecac! Ah, Davy! Davy! Yes, Davy! Davy! But it is the well Davy--the little face framed at the window, waiting for papa, waiting to know about Josephus--it is that Davy which stimulates the soul. "No, ma'am!" He ought to be relieved. It gives you more pain than it gives to Davy." "Yes, sir." It is your duty." Duty! He adds water. He rinses his mouth. Here, lamby! Here, lamby! Let mamma help you." "Oh, David, don't hurt him!" He seizes the child as the spoiler of a city might begin his rapine. "Oh, David, David!" "Another," he nods. Please, papa!" She pities the man. The room is at eighty degrees. "I have heard my mother say," says Esther, "that a child is eased by a change of flannels. the man cries. asks the woman. he prays. The housekeeper has taken Esther's place at Davy's couch. But brave he is. he says. "Glad to see you, Mr. Corkey. Nobody happier than me to-day." Corkey announces on the docks. "Why, he's the machine man, Corkey. "Cert. "Not by the marines, Corkey." Corkey is accordingly elected, and all hands take a drink at the other fellow's invitation, for which the great Corkey demands the privilege of paying. I know how sickness is, but my wife died while I was in charge of one campaign. Politics is politics. If he comes further, a-repeating, you folks must fight. Such are the day's injunctions of the political boss. It is only a special election in one district. "I lie, do I?" says Lockwin. Corkey sits on the wagon in front. The battle is over. Corkey is pronounced a white-flag man. They shake hands with Lockwin and deploy on the threatened precincts. In theory it was good. The party can trust its delegates. Corkey is an oddity. "That's what you bloodsuckers make Lockwin do. Corkey has blundered. Such are the preparatory comments of the audience. Such are the flattering outbursts. The Sneeze has come. "That settles it!" None of them go out. "That's the stuff!" "That's what! It was adopted without a dissenting voice." "Oh, is he?" The speech goes on. "It is," says the orator, "the proudest day of my life, I assure you." The orator is gathering an audience. The form straightens. The orator weeps and he thunders. The orator weeps and he thunders. It is done in every campaign. The orator's speech may be impassioned, but he is thinking of Davy. The orator may be infusing the noblest of patriotism in his hearers' hearts, but often he hardly knows what he is saying. The hearer confesses that the question is unanswered. Davy is to continue the emetic treatment. "Oh, Davy, you'll kill us!" "He'll kill himself," says the cook. "Are you sure he is safe?" asks Esther. "Are you sure it was asthma?" "Oh, yes. I know Mr. Lockwin would be angry if he knew." You must soon give him air. Let him play a while in the back yard. "Yes, I guess he'd better." "Be careful of the boy, Esther," he says. I wish I could have heard him!" he is saying. "Yes," says the wife. By-bye, Esther." "Yes, I know," says the man. "Bravo, professor, bravo! You are a great artist." professor, bravo!" "Kiss me, Davy!" But it is as if Davy were too hard at work with an article. They go below, where Davy has told the cook of the extraordinary professor who can scarcely speak English. It hurt my head." "Yes, you darlint," says the cook; "here's some ice cream. Eat it now." "I can't eat anything but medicine," says Davy, "and I have to eat that or papa wouldn't love me. "Ah, yes, darlint. "T-double-e-t-h," observes the scholarly Davy. "My! my!" Well, let it be a little. Yes, the glasses are not large. Yes. "To the Congress--ah, yes, to the Congress." "He is naturally an unhappy man," she says, "but Davy and I are making him happier." Yes, this is distinctly happy--this night at home, in the chamber after the music, with Davy to sleep over here, too. But it is difficult to moderate the spirits of the boy. He is playing all sorts of pranks with his father. the man laughs, "it is that cut-throat wind!" Come here, Davy." "How stupid I am," thinks the man. He seizes the arch boy and clasps him in his arms. Wait a few minutes. Please, Davy." Now, again. Let us see about that. Yes, it is going fast enough now. Of course it is going. The full vibration of the struggling lungs resounds through the man's frame. "No, David, no. See, he's asleep. Put him here. Go right to bed. Davy is tired out. To be sure, he must be worse when he is tired." "Why, no, of course not. "No," says Esther. Music rested him, he said." he demands. He is only partly awake. "Oh, David!" The room is cold. he has said, brutally. "No, my darling." The case is chronic. each says. He sees a crowd of men down the street. Corkey is running as an independent democrat, because the democratic convention did not indorse him after he bolted from the Lockwin convention. Yes, that accounts for the strange disorganization of the household. Plenty of them to be had. The pan is dry. But look at Davy first. Let us carry him back where the stove is." "I buried seven," she says. "Yes, and every one with membrainyous croup. They seems so full of life just before they go. Oh, my! Oh, my!" It gives him something to do to get it. He enters the kitchen. the man says. It is Davy. "Yes, mamma is here." "Are you suffering, precious?" See, you breathe easily now." The afternoon wanes. "Georgie Day, mamma." "Yes, lamby." "I haven't been here since to-morrow week. Davy is white as marble. His breath comes hard. "Very well, then. It is diphtheria." Get us a surgeon." He loved Davy. "Well, Mr. asks the father, resolutely. "It will prolong his life if the shock do not result fatally." "Yes, I think so." "Yes, sir." "Let us go in." "No, no!" "No, no!" "No, Davy. "It must be," says Lockwin. "I have not brought my instruments," says the surgeon. It is David Lockwin putting his unhappy cheek beside the little face. J-o-s-e-p--" "Yes, Davy. Papa knows. Thank you, Davy. Davy is dead. No one else shall touch it! Let us have that ironing-board! Oh, God! "Josephus, papa." Yes, yes, Davy. The orator stands over his dead. "It will be better," says Richard Tarbelle. It will be better." How fortunate it has come. The orator goes up by a rear stairway. The orator lifts his voice. The form sways, the finger points. Oh, Davy, my darlint! she cries. asks the first citizen. Now it is but a memory. No one is there. The orator speaks on. He weeps and he thunders. cries Dr. Tarpion. Of course, it was highly important that his stomach should be preserved. "Well, David, let us speak of it no more. You must do exactly as our leader directs." Corkey is an unknown factor. "I just made you fellers screw your nut for 2,000 crooked votes," says Corkey. See Corkey.' "Go on." If he resigns, I want it. If he catches on, all right. I know a way home that will leave us alone for two days or more. "All right; Lockwin shall go." It's collector or Congress, sure. "All right." Corkey therefore sails for Duluth. "Yes, a little boy. Good-bye, boys. It is Sunday. Stay and see him. "He is dead and buried," says Lockwin in their ear. He is weak from an illness, of which he knows little. "Oh, my dear sir, no. None of them are as pretty as he was." Here is a world of which he knew nothing. "This is Davy's father." Lucky I found you." Corkey is at Owen Sound. The boy stammers in his speech. "N-n-n-noah!" he replies. "N-n-n-noah!" laughs Corkey. "N-n-n-noah," answers the boy. Corkey from this moment rejects the collectorship, and stakes all on going to Congress. "Nixy. But it would be easy to throw him from the deck to-night. "Easy enough. It's out of the world, too. He rises. "Well, if I come to such a place as this I must expect a jackleg railroad. Good stiff fall breeze, too." He finds some sailors, tells them how he was elected to Congress, slaps them on the back, tries to split the bar with his fist, a feat which has often won votes, and tightens his heart with raw Canadian whisky. "'Spose so," nods Corkey. "To be sure." "That settles it. "How-dy-do, Corkey. "Well, cap, I had a long slate to fix up when I came here. Mr. Troy, Mr. Lockwin. Mr. Mr. Flood, Mr. Lockwin. Mr. Corkey is seized with a paroxysm of tobacco strangling, ending with a sneeze that is a public event. Corkey would get to strangling and then would end with a sneeze that would carry the house. "That's what it is!" says Mr. Bodine. But Corkey has not only done the polite act. "I might have given him a false name. The party drinks. "I have no reason to like it," says Lockwin. The paroxysm has made a coward of Corkey. asks Corkey of Captain Grant. Corkey has regarded this demeanor as a political wile. Corkey has observed to himself. "He's going to resign, sure. Excuse me, Mr. Lockwin, but are ye sick any?" "No," says Lockwin, and he is not sick. He wishes he were. "Well, let's git to business, then. You must excuse me, but--" Corkey is seized with a paroxysm. asks the mate, peering out of his room and then going on deck. He straightens his legs, sinks his chin and pushes his hands far in his pockets. asks Lockwin, his thoughts far away. "Well, pard, if you're not sick, I'd like to say a good many things. Corkey produces a long list of names, written on copy-paper. "Needn't be afraid, pard. Corkey is pleased with his own remark. I know that. Corkey is terrified. It will give you nothing. "That's what the administration said, too," replies Lockwin. asks Corkey. Corkey grows black in the face. He hiccoughs. He strangles. he cries savagely. asks Corkey, in retort. "That's what she is!" replies the mate. Corkey looks like a man relieved. Politics is off his mind. It was dim under that swinging lamp. It is dark out here. The wind is bitter. asks Corkey. "Plenty," says the second mate. asks Corkey. Corkey has climbed to the upper deck and stands there alone in the darkness and the gale. The engine stops. Corkey is feeling about one of these yawls. He strains at a rope. Nobody else comes up the ladders. He seizes the stern of the yawl and hoists it far over the upper deck. The davit is good." But Corkey is the only man on the ship who thinks the idea practicable. he vows, and recrosses. he mutters. "I can't do it!" he says, and gets out his knife. Corkey peers down on deck. He sees human forms hurrying past the cabin window, and there is reflected the yellow, wooden, ribby thing which he knows to be a life-preserver. he laments. The wind is perhaps less boisterous since the engine slacked. Corkey never saw so much foam before. he comments. Corkey is startled. Corkey has short, tough fingers. he mutters. Corkey is under the steamer's side, deep in the waves. The tug increases. he cries, in bitter disappointment. But, lo! his knife is in his hands. he says. Corkey pulls on the hand--a head--a kinky head--comes next. Corkey pulls with both hands. The boy begins bailing with his hands. he commands in tones that are heard for a hundred yards. The boy paddles with his hands. he says. They, too, are thrown far aloft. They, too, sink deeply. They must be thick. He angers Corkey. It leaps less like an athlete. But it is incredible that any more should get in the yawl. It leaps less lightly. "You're from the Africa, ain't you? "You're Noah. All you fellers." Hands rise. The boy turns on the gunwale, as it were a trapeze. He finds a tin pie-plate. He bails. Corkey gets in. stammers the boy. Now 114 are drowned. stammers the boy. The boy bails incessantly. stammers the boy, feeling slowly in the stern. he begs. Corkey has lived an age since he saw that light. stammers the obedient lad. asks Corkey, greatly moved at a sight so affecting. "It is," signals Lockwin. The head rises and Corkey strains his ear. "I'm dying, Corkey. I wanted to thank you." The head falls again on the stern seat. asks the oarsman. answers the man. Corkey has been sobbing. But Corkey's voice is far from menacing. Corkey is weak. He rises and points. Corkey has heard of mirages in shipwreck. he says, a moment later, as he sees a tamarack scrub. On comes the point. The boy's face is all contortions. commands the man. He touches bottom and is swept off. He puts down the lad. he commands. A life is a life. Corkey works for that paper. "Yes, but begin with the thrilling scenes." "Of course you didn't." "Well, dry up. "That's what wrecked her," observes the witty reporter. Corkey gazes scornfully at his inquisitors. He die off the point in the boat. stammers the mascot. "Yes," say the eager interviewers, "go on." Go on yourselves. It was dark. "It wasn't no shipwreck, I tell you: not like a real shipwreck. She just drap. But that first mate, he was a bird, and I guess the second mate wasn't no better. But don't say that, boys. Ask Corkey over and over. That will never do for Corkey's paper. He hurries to the telegraph office. He finds a shipwreck to suit his needs. The full moon rises. The wind abates. Corkey is a short man, short in speech. "Too bad there wasn't no starving," he laments. Only Two Saved. Such are some of the many headings. Corkey and his mascot are still at Wiarton. Corkey is superintending the search for the yawl and Lockwin's body. Corkey is exhibiting his mascot, pounding on the hotel bar and accepting the congratulations of all who will take a drink. Corkey stands sidewise to the bar, his hand on the glass. Then he brings his adamantine fist down on the bar to the peril of all glassware. "Yes, sir! "Well, I didn't do no such foolish thing as you fellows, did I?" "Go to Congress," she says. "Outlive your enemies. Outlive your enemies, David." He was socially her equal. He was essentially the man she might love, for there was an element of unrest in his nature that corresponded with the turmoil underneath her calm exterior. he had asked. "You are elected to Congress, David," she said. "Are you not glad?" "Yes," he answered, and looked like death itself. Let him travel with her alone! she said. "Yes," he answered, and became whiter. he asked. "Yes, dear," she said. But she had not dared to be frank. she had said, as she kissed him. It was Sunday. It was entirely unlike the cold Esther Lockwin to be acting in this manner. It was 4:50. Let us go to Europe once more. Let us seek out the places where you and I have met in the past." No! Then he will not get the letter! You mustn't let him go again. Or go home, if you want to be there." "NIAGARA FALLS, Oct. Owen Sound, Owen Sound. Yes, here is Owen Sound. "OWEN SOUND, Oct. Corkey and Noah are nearing the residence of Esther Lockwin. Corkey had hoped he might have a moment of grace. "Step in," she says. A spasm seizes his throat. He strangles. He coughs. He sneezes. The boy strives to stand behind, but Corkey feels more secure if the companion be held in front. But Corkey must pull himself together. "That's what I am, or was, madam; and you ain't no sorrier for that than me." "I can't do that, nohow; and the less said about it the better. "That's what it was, your honor, madam." He was an aristocratic duck, and I will say that I thought it was his bar'l that beat me." The widow is striving so hard to understand that the man speaks more slowly. "That's what it is, and it's mighty dirty work. I notice that. A nod, and Corkey is well pleased. He sit back, out straight, like this, his hands deep in his pockets, his legs crossed onto each other, his hat down, and his chin way down--see?" Corkey is regaining his presence of mind. The widow attests the correctness of Corkey's illustration. I talk and talk. The widow cannot understand. "That's what it is. 'Mr. I know I sneezed--and you must excuse me out there a while ago--and a big first mate he tried to put the hoodoo on me. I know it was me who hurt Lockwin with the oars. He showed up at daybreak, you see. I asks. But it is far too much for the navigator. Corkey." Corkey is feeling in all his pockets. Come and see me often. Corkey bows himself down the steps. Go on, now!" he exclaims. Corkey is himself again. The head sets up a vibration something like the movement of a rattlesnake before it strikes. The speech comes forth. He ruminates. he says. Corkey advances to toss the handkerchief in the fire. Corkey started to throw something in the fire, and has kept to his purpose. Corkey is not blind to this general uneasiness. He whistles. "Well, if she had needed the stuff she'd a been after it soon enough, wouldn't she? But that ain't the point. If I win, you git $500. Corkey had once been rich when he did not know the value of wealth. Corkey is at last on the shores of Georgian Bay. "He has no grave, and yet your hyenas are barking, and barking. The memory of the dead man's oratory stirs the community. asks the second philosopher. "To be sure. "Yes, but he was a beautiful child. "It was Lockwin's name--let me see--David." "Oh, yes, Davy, they called him." "Well, she has erected the prettiest sarcophagus in the whole cemetery for Davy. That accounts for it." "Oh, David, David, come back! Oh, my own! How fortunate you are." The soprano sings. The orator is at his best. But she will do no such thing. "I might die," she says, moodily. The memorial rises. It becomes a city lion. she weeps. The sublime selfishness of human pride had driven her on the rocks of destruction. The heavy bell of sorrow clangs loudly upon this article of her pride, ambition and lack of address to the true interests of her dead lord. Oh, David! The paroxysm passes. No! So comes the morning. "Oh, David! The widow gazes far aloft. Now, how to do it. Davy is no more. No. He is of first-class family. You must contest." Let us see how it fared with Lockwin's friend Orthwaite, who found life to be insupportable. It was suicide, said the press--bald, cowardly, pitiful. Oh, yes, the ship is foundering because Corkey is in the way of this great business. Corkey should be flung in the sea and well rid of him. It distracts one's thoughts from an insoluble problem; How to shuffle off this coil--not of life, but of respectability, conspicuity, environment! This must be what excited Corkey. He enters the holocaust and passes into nothingness, feeling heavy blows. Corkey questions the sinking man, and Lockwin tries to tell of the money--the deposit of $75,000 to the order of a fictitious person. But it is a persistent chambermaid. Ah, now the bed is lifted up and down. This must be seen to. Oh, yes! He finds a handkerchief and ties up his face. He sees a cabin at a distance. He finds he has money in plenty. It was David Lockwin, in theory, who suffered all the ills of life. It will be well to husband it. Here is a handsome Josephus--as fine as the one in Chicago. You are free at least. Let us read these newspaper accounts. He puts forth for books. Let him find better accommodations among the Frenchmen and Italians on Sixth avenue. Why, here is a page of panegyric. Here is a large portrait of the late Hon. He compares the two faces. "A change. he exclaims sadly. He takes a chair and greedily reads the apotheosis of David Lockwin. He is wounded and unhappy. he cries, and goes in search of the books that once eased him--the identical copies. The movement for a cenotaph makes him smile. No! "He must be an inventor. Dear sakes, but he is homely." The move is a wise one. he cries in astonishment, as he purchases great files of old Chicago papers. He takes up his heavy load of newspapers and finds a boy to carry them. he says, and sobs. Nobody loves Robert Chalmers. Nobody respects Robert Chalmers. he says. It was like the Africa in mid-sea, foundering. His voice is husky. He enters a street-car for the north. Chalmers makes bold to ask the conductor. "That's what it will!" "You are?" "That's what I am. My name is Corkey." "Clad to meet you. My name is Chalmers. "Yes, I've got tired of telling it. "Mrs. Oh, it's a cooler. Oh, that will be all right out here. Say Eau Claire. Here is some copy paper. Sit side of me. Go on, now!" They sent for me at the office. Corkey tries to be loquacious. Corkey slaps his leg. He quakes his head. He sneezes. he cries, frowning majestically on Corkey. I'd be sorry for him. asks Lockwin. Then he wonders what may be in these envelopes. asks Corkey. "I have a little in a New York bank," he says. Corkey looks on the book. I'm fixed myself." Corkey examines the list of failures. Buy of me, mister. Corkey will now start in search of the body of David Lockwin! Yes. He enters the hotel dining-room. The head waiter seats his guest at a table where three men are eating. "In Vermont." "She did." "Well, it's a pretty thing. I wish I were rich. asks the third party, "No. "Well, I never knew a town to be so full of one man as this town is of Lockwin. He rises. he corrects. Of course he cannot go. He seeks his room. He weeps for the past. He is living. He ought to be dead. He is poor. Oh, Davy! Davy! The hours go past. yes. Davy! Davy's tomb. He rises and turns on the gas. That will help. Yes, it was a burglar, for there is now a brass sheath to prevent another entry. The subject is odious. He clutches that. He wishes he had not read. He turns to the next page. Let us go to Europe once more. Let's seek the places where we have met in the past." I know it's pretty late. He vows it is good. He was on his way to Esther's to tell her all. It was easy to marry her, because I was wealthy. I am a poor man now." He repeats it over and over. It gives him business. To be sure, this is better. asks the night editor, who is in command of the paper. asks the night editor. asks the telegraph editor. mutters Corkey. asks the assistant telegraph editor. The head vibrates, the little tongue plays about the black tobacco, the mouth grows square. "He's been moving," the boy whispers to the night editor. "Yes," grunts Corkey. "That's a five-story building, isn't it?" "That's what it is." Corkey is busy fixing his telegrams for the printer. Corkey has made a hundred trips to the new abode, each time laden with some heavy piece of furniture or package of goods. The head quakes, the tongue plays, he looks defiantly at the night editor. The head quakes, but it is not a sneeze. He gapes and stretches. Give it to me. Corkey has not failed to plume himself on his aristocratic and familiar acquaintance. Corkey is to take the telegraph editor to call on Mrs. Lockwin. is repeated. But Corkey cannot hear. Can take you to spot. Corkey seizes the dispatch, puts on his coat, and rides downstairs. He enters the telegraph operators' room, where five men are at work receiving special intelligence. "Get Collingwood, boys." "That drops off at Detroit. CORKEY. he cries, and pulls at his hair, rubs his eyes and stamps on the floor. the man at last declares. No man with $7,000 in his pocket is poor. No, he has means. Oh, yes. He shows it. He was foolhardy a moment before. He was rich. Love makes him happy. Corkey has been the earliest caller. Corkey is struck with the idea of business. "It was so always." "It was so the first day I met you. "Yep. "I do." "Well, I find it." Let's see if it tears. Oh, yes, about the yawl. Yes." The coronation, yes. Moscow, yes." Corkey is in front of the, case holding a newspaper in hand, out of which he has been reading of the coronation. Can't tell me! Nobody see it and it was worth money, too. He sit just so." Corkey takes a seat behind the stove and imitates David Lockwin. "He must have been," says the druggist, "if he wasn't killed." Can't tell me. Corkey looks at the prescription booth. "Yes," says the druggist, huskily. "Yes, oftener than I want to. He ain't dead. But she seems to harp on that. Well, now. Oh, she's no use. Corkey is earnest. "Yes," says the druggist huskily. "Yes," says the druggist. Corkey takes the glass graduate in hand. He turns sideways and puts his arm heavily on the frail show-case. He ruminates. Yes, I thought so. he suggests. Yes, that's nearer to my size than a whole congressional district. I'm in for it. But that's not now. My mind is over there, on the avenue. He rinses it. Chalmers, just fill that thimble-rig once more. Hurry, for I got to go to the north pier right off. A customer wants a cigar. He sees a crowd gathering at a corner and making demonstrations in a cross street. Yes, it is Esther! He takes the middle of the street. he cries. They shy. Yes, I thought so. But she sets up there like a hired man--you've got a good nob now! No, you don't spend no money on me. I wish you could git out and hustle, though. Corkey must do the greater part of the talking. It tickles his membranes. Oh, yes, yes! Corkey looks out into the store. "I heard he was hurt," says Esther. "Mr. Chalmers, you find me unable to express my feelings. It distresses Corkey. "That's what he was--a white man!" Good-bye, Mr. Chalmers." Corkey." The widow tarries. The clerk moves with astonishing celerity. Chalmers is well off," says Corkey. Good-bye, Mr. Corkey. You are neglecting me lately. I wish I could vote. Oh, yes, I guess the clerk may give me a stock of white notepaper. Yes, that will do. Send plenty. Good-bye. I'm tired of my troubles. Good-bye." Others need him--not he them. It is only genius that can adapt itself to an environment so lugubrious. It is only genius that can unhorse suspicion itself, leaving even the would-be detractor to admit that Mr. Harpwood is a kind man--as he certainly is. It was he who, lost in the opium habit, went to his room for two weeks, and kept the pieces of opium and bottles of morphine within sight on his mantel, touching none of the drug--curing himself. Corkey is picturesque as he raps his cane on the marble stairs. He enters. Corkey sits down. Then he stands up. "Not at all. I am getting well," is the cheerful reply. Corkey is in trouble. "I am quite happy," Lockwin says. "It will be a sufficient reward to look like other folks. But it is a trial." It will be a success. "Yes, just come from there." "Yes. "Well, you ought to see the office she give me! Oh, yes! Here I have the best future. You are a helpful soul, Esther. He, too, is in love. "I have nothing to be ashamed of, have I?" "Well, he's marrying the woman who can help him most. asks Corkey. "Mr. Chalmers is not in," answers the clerk. "He is not in," retorts the clerk with spirit. "No." "I can't tell you. Excuse me." A customer waits. "Yes, yes, yes!" growls Corkey. "I do not know." The clerk is telling the truth, and is in turn offended. "I do not know," he says, resolutely. Corkey is convinced. He hurries away. Corkey is drenched, and of all things he dreads a drenching. Corkey goes to his home. "Commodore, we're sorry for you. Take it easy, and get back to work. No man can live, doing as you've done.
