 But that was her ladyship's way, and "Don't talk to me!" Leave me. I want to talk to him. Go into the garden, and wait by the lily-pond. Marjorie went out, with hanging head and bursting heart. She loved; who could help loving happy-go-lucky, handsome Tom Arundel, who well-nigh worshipped the ground her little feet trod upon? But she did not hate Hugh. He had come in, a man of two-and-thirty, big and broad, with suntanned face and eyes as blue as the tear-dimmed eyes of the girl who had gone miserably down to the lily-pond. "Well, it is absurdâ"you realise that?" "It is childish folly!" "He's a good fellow," said Hugh generously. I know how to deal with gels. He had loved it all his life, but latterly he had realised that there was something missing, something without which the old house could not be home to him, and in his dreams waking and sleeping he had seen this same little white-clad figure seated at the foot of the great table in the dining-hall. He had seen her in his mind's eye doing those little housewifely duties that the mistresses of Hurst Dormer had always loved to do, her slender fingers busy with the rare and delicate old china, or the lavender-scented linen, or else in the wonderful old garden, the gracious little mistress of all and of his heart. And now she sat drooping like a wilted lily beside the green pond, because of her love for another man, and his honest heart ached that it should be so. "Marjorie!" he said. she said. "Oh, if you knew!" "I see," he said quietly. he saidâ""clear right away, go to Africa, or somewhere or other?" If onlyâ"only you were married; that is the only thing that would have saved me!" "Oh, Hugh, butâ"" She looked up at him quickly. "But it would be a lie!" Listen, little maid. That meant she sent me here to ask you to marry me, and I meant to do it. he said, and spoke his thoughts aloud. "Of course it would be a shock to her, perhaps she wouldn't believe!" "Tell me just what you will say." Marjorie said with a laugh; it was the first time she had laughed, and he liked to hear it. "Fine," Hugh said. "Where at, though?" "Of course! "It is a hateful place, but that doesn't matter," said Marjorie. But she could not guess, how could she, how in spite of the laughter on his lips there was a great ache and a feeling of emptiness at his heart. "So now we have it all complete," he said. He laughed. "Only the lady's name." Marjorie shook her head. Let's hear from you, Marjorie." she said. Marjorie, do you think she will swallow it?" she whispered. Marjorie lifted a pair of soft arms and put them about his neck. she said, "Hugh, ifâ"if I had never known Tom, Iâ"" "I know," he said. "But there is one that I can see." He paused. He nodded. "Yes, it was when I went down to see her there, andâ"" "You met this woman you married? Marjorie had invented itâ"at least, he believed so. I always regarded you as more or less a fool, but Joan Meredyth is a girl any man might fall in love with!" He had counted on the name being a pure invention, and nowâ" "Where is she?" "Why?" "We didn't get on, you see. "Yes," Lady Linden said thoughtfully, "I suppose she did. And now, where is she?" she said witheringly. We will discuss it some other timeâ"it is a matter I prefer not to talk about! "Yes, I much prefer not to talk about it. "Marjorie is the sweetest little soul in the world, andâ"" "It's a pity you didn't think of that three years ago!" "Oh, go away thenâ"and leave me to myself. He went gladly enough; he made his way back to the lily-pond. "Marjorie," he said tragically, "what have you done?" "Oh, Hugh!" "No, no, dear, don't worry; it is nothing. Marjorie flushed. "That's all right then! It's all right, little girl; it is all right. "I want you to take a letter to Jarvis and Purcell, Miss Meredyth," he said. He stretched out his hand to touch her, and she drew back. "Look here, you won't get another job in a hurry, and you know it. "Come, be sensible!" He had never meant to say this, yet he had said it, for the fascination of her was on him. She held her head very proudly. "Of course!" He had kept this back as the last, the supreme temptation, the very last card in his hand; and he had played it, and behold, it proved to be no trump. "I had to do it, I had to, or I could not have respected myself any longer," the girl thought, as she made her way home that evening to the boarding-house, where for two pounds a week she was fed and lodged. No, she believed now that she had heard that Mrs. Ransome was dead; perhaps the General too, yet she would risk it. "It seems so to me," she said quietly. "So you mean going, then?" He looked at her, and there was eagerness in his eyes. Perhaps they can't be drivenâ"very often donkeys can't; but they can be led!" "Oh, Mr. Alston," the footman said, "my lady is expecting you. She told me to show you straight into the drawing-room, and she andâ"" The man paused. "Yes, sir, thank you, sir," the man said. "This way, Mr. Alston." And now in the drawing-room Hugh was cooling his heels. She looked at him calmly and casually, and seemed to hesitate; and then behind her appeared Lady Linden, flushed, and evidently agitated. "There," she said, "there, my dearsâ"I have brought you together again, and now everything must be made quite all right! Yes, poverty was the keynote to it all. "Thenâ"thenâ"" Again the glorious flush came into her cheeks, but was gone again, leaving her whiter, colder than before, only her eyes seemed to burn with the fire of anger and contempt. "Yes," he said. I do not think that a girl has ever been placed in such a false position as I have been through yourâ"cowardly lie." He had probably never known actual fear in his life, nor a sense of shame such as he knew now. He had nothing to say, he wanted to explain, yet could not, for Marjorie's sake. I do not know why you have done this, perhaps it is your idea of humour." he said hotly. She looked at him, and her beautiful eyes narrowed. She did not hear, or affected not to. She looked back at him, contempt in her gaze. He had not meant to say it; he had to say something, and it seemed to him that her anger against him was almost unreasonable. He would give her time to cool down, for her wrath to evaporate, then he would seek her out, and tell her as much as he couldâ"tell her that the secret was not entirely his own. He would appeal to the generosity that he had told her she did not possess. "Well, she has. "That's it," he said, "a great deal more! He nodded. Perhaps she was over-sensitive and a little unreasonable, but she would not admit it. Marjorie had spoken of this man in effusive admiration. She did not question her own anger. She did not ask herself, was it reasonable? Alston." She looked with blazing eyes at the manâ""Mrs. Alston..." Even the servant! "For you, ma'am, of course," said the man. And now this useless journey had eaten deeply into the little store. "No," Joan said. Perhaps you could let me have a cup of tea in my room, Mrs. "Well, it's rather inconvenient with all the washing-up to do, and as you know I make it a rule that boarders have to be in to their meals, or go withoutâ"stillâ"" "Please don't trouble!" Joan said stiffly. She opened it, and read it. He had seen Marjorie for a few moments, had soothed her, and told her not to worry, that it was not her fault. He had kissed her in brotherly fashion, and had wondered a little at himself for the slight feeling of impatience against her that came to him. He had never been impatient of her before, but her tears this afternoon unreasonably annoyed him. I should love to manage for him." "Well, well, we shall see!" Marjorie flushed to her eyes. "Oh, thank you so much!" Meanwhile, Hugh Alston had retired to his house at Hurst Dormer in a none too happy frame of mind. He had rowed with Lady Linden, had practically told her to mind her own business, which was a thing everyone had been wishing she would do for the past ten years, and no one had ever dared tell her to. I got out the car, and drove here myself. "But I must, it is all because of me; and, Hugh, aunt has asked Tom to dinner to-day." She looked at him. "It is no good trying to make light of it. I know you've been worried. I know you andâ"and Joan must have had a scene yesterday, or she wouldn't have left the house without even seeing me." He nodded. "I think so, too. She took it badly." It is all my fault, Hugh. "Yes, Hugh, what about Joan? "Yes, Hugh, what shall you do? I know you have something in your mind." He would not let Miss Meredyth witness his sense of satisfaction. So Joan came back and took up her old work, and Mr. Slotman practised temporarily a courtesy and a forbearance that were foreign to him. He would offer her no explanations, because the secret was not his own, and nothing must happen now that might upset or tell against Marjorie's happiness. He would express regret for what had happened, ask her to try and realise that no indignity and no insult had ever been intended against her, and then he would offer her his hand, but certainly not his heart. He did not deny her loveliness. "Yes, she's a clerk or something in the City. He nodded. "Well, I don't know that it is usual for visitors to call on lady clerks. If I might make a suggestion I'd say send in your card to Mr. Slotman, and ask his permission to see Miss Meredyth." "Very good, I'll see him." He looked keenly at Hugh, and the first spark of jealousy was ignited in his system. If you will sit down, I will go out and send her to you, Mr.â"Alston." He looked at the girl, her white face, the hard line made by a mouth that should be sweet and gentle. "To me, very! He looked at her, paused for a moment to give her an opportunity of speaking, but she did not speak. She looked at him steadily. "Only that I am offering it to you, myself and all I possess. He had come to regard Joan as something infinitely superior to himself. He had come to realise it little by little. And now everything had undergone a change. And now he stood listening eagerly, holding his breath waiting for her answer. "Why?" Very well, then... But what a lovely face it is, and for just that moment, when the hardness and bitterness were gone..." He paused; his own face softened. said Hugh. He sighed a little drearily. He sighed sentimentally, and took out Marjorie's little pink note from his pocket-book. In fact, he disliked pink. Marjorie was happy, Lady Linden was beaming on Tom Arundel, the cloud had lifted from Marjorie's life. "That's that!" he said. Then he laughed gently. "Beg your pardon, sir?" he asked. "That's all right!" He went away, not completely satisfied as to this visitor's sanity, and Hugh drifted back into dreams and memories. He went to the theatre that night. he said. he said again. He had turned to the last page and looked at the signature. "Here, General," said the young secretary. "Hudson!" "Yes, sir!" Yes, go on!" "That's the man then, that's the man!" I knew the girl's father, and the boy's too. "Very good, sir!" said Hudson. "Hudson, I am getting to be a forgetful old fool," he said. "Well, Hudson?" "I think it would be a good idea, General," Hudson said. I know that a man offered you marriage to atone for the pastâ"to atoneâ"you hear me? the girl said quietly. Joan looked at her face in the glass. She looked at it critically. she said, "Oh!" She did not scruple to accept it in the spirit of affection in which it was offered. He had said that he would send for her when the morning came; he had taken it for granted that she would go, and there was no need to answer the letter. Joan went down. But she came into it now eagerly, with bright eyes and flushed cheeks, and hand held out, only to draw back with sudden chill. I want you to forgive me." But what I said, after all, was right enough. I know more about you than I think you guess. I know about that fellow, thatâ"what's his name?â"Alstonâ"who came. I know why he came." I am not surprised." he said thickly. "Why?" "Whyâ"why?" he said. "Why?" I want you! My luggage is ready, Annie. She looked back at Slotman. He looked down and saw a car, by no means a cheap car, and he knew the value of things, none better. "Well, I'll be hanged! He looked at her, and then he kissed her. "I blame myself, I do indeed. I knew him well, and his dear little wife tooâ"your mother, my child, one of the loveliest women I ever saw. he asked. "Hudson, where's Hudson? And now you are here, you will stay here with us for a long time, a very long time. It can't be too long, my dear. I am a lonely old man, but we'll do our best to make you happy." "I think," Joan said softly, "that you have done that already! He had thought of going to the city and calling on Mr. Philip Slotman again. He had meant it well; but, looking back, it struck him that he had acted like a conceited fool. He had thought to make all right, by bestowing all his possessions and his person on her, and she had put him in his place, had declined even without thanks. "Who?" he added aloud. "That's quite satisfactory then; I'll see him," said Hugh. He had a dim recollection of the old fellow, as one of his father's friends, who in the old days, when he was a child, had come down to Hurst Dormer; but the recollection was dim. "How did you find me out here, sir?" "Ah, ha! George Alston, of Hurst Dormer." I want to talk over old times!" He had meant to ask himâ"he had asked him actually, and the General had not explained. "I will do you the justice, Mr. Alston, to believe that you did not anticipate this meeting?" If you ask me to explain what I did and why I did it, I cannot do so. I can see now what sort of a figure I made of myself, and how I must have appeared to you when I was bragging of my possessions. I do not know what it wasâ"my folly, my immense conceitâ"for which perhaps you pitied me. It is all selfish passion and ugliness!" I do not think it is that, I think you have a sense of humour somewhat perverted. He did not know himself, did not recognise the old, happy-go-lucky Hugh Alston, who had accepted many a hard knock from Fate with a smile and a jest. she said bitterly. "I think I have. I, of course, am the one to go. Is that enough? The strangeness of it did not occur to him, yet it did to her. "Good-bye!" "Good-bye!" she said, and then turned quickly, and in a moment the door was closed between them. He did not see her hurry away, her hands pressed against her breast. He did not see the face, all womanly and sweet, and soft and tender now. He had only the memory of her brief farewell, the memory of her cold, steady eyesâ"nothing else beside. He paused. he promised. "You!" "Yes, I too! I knew the lad's father as I knew yours. She told me that she loved you both, that you were both good, that life might be made very happy for you two, but for this misunderstandingâ"" "Don't!â"don't. He looked at her, blinking like one who suddenly finds himself in strong light after the twilight or darkness. "It is all extraordinary! Joan cried bitterly. I know that you meant well when you brought that man and me face to face last nightâ"that manâ"" She paused. "I cannot stop here and live on your charity!" He broke off, for there was a puzzled look in the girl's face. So the house and the money become yours, Miss Meredyth. "Of course, if you prefer it and wish it, my dear." said Joan. If only for a time, let me arrange with her to go with you." "I'll write to her at once," the General said, and Joan nodded, little dreaming what the sending of that letter might mean to her. "About her. Bloomberg drew at his cigar. "Of course you know she's come into money, a pot of money and a fine place down in the country. Rankin acts for me, a sound man. I was talking to him the other day, and your name cropped up." Ah, ha!" Bloomberg laughed. "I did. Well, I must go. Yes, he would have married her. He frowned, Ah! he had it now, for his memory was a good one. "To the manner born," she thought. It is about a marriageâ"" The old gentleman paused. "Look here, I'll tell you. "No, that is, Iâ"I don't know. "I remembered that." They are two of the dearest peopleâ"the children, you know, of Alfred's brother Matthew." "That's it, that's it! Take her about; let her see people, young people. Yes, she was a capable woman, far more capable than even General Bartholomew realised. "I will break down her reserve. Helen asked. "It is all wonderful, beautiful!" Joan said, and yet she spoke with a touch of sadness in her voice.... "Howâ"how lonely one might be here!" she added. If you are, it will be of your own choice!" I am sorry, Iâ"I was thinking." Joan looked up. They are coming to-morrow, dear. "I am sure I shall," Joan said; but there was no enthusiasm in her voice, only cold politeness that seemed to chill a little. "I glory in it," she was thinking, "and take not one word of it back." He had handed her over to eighteen-year-old Constance. He paused. said John. "And wants us to come over, dear." "Of course! She looked fierce-eyed at Connie and then at John. He had a jolly laugh, a great hearty laugh that did one good to hear. he asked, for "gipsy" was his pet name for the little dark beauty. the girl said, whereat John laughed again. He paused, frowning, at thought. He nodded. Meanwhile write to Helen, and tell her we'll be over to-morrow afternoon." "Whyâ"no, child, you'll stop at home and look after the house, eh?" He nodded to them and went out. "Who, dear?" "This Helen, your aunt. the girl asked quickly. "I think," said Constance gently, "that you are very silly and foolish!" "I'll write that we'll go to-morrow, dear," John said. I should be glad, Johnny. And now she looked at her with interest. "Come," she said, "Joan is in the garden. Helen added to John. So here she is." the girl asked. "I think," Helen said slowly, "that she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen." "Well, you ought to be a very happy little girl. "Aunt, you haven't heard anything ofâ"of Hugh?" You were right and I was wrong. Marjorie thought as she turned away. she said to herself. "I love Tom with all my heart and soul, and now I am the happiest girl living." But she was not, and she knew it. He had busied himself with the work, had entered whole-heartedly into all the plans, had counted up the cost, and then, realising that all his enthusiasm was only forced, that he was merely trying to cheat himself, he lost interest and gave it up. He had promised that he would never molest her, never annoy her with his visits or his presence, and he meant religiously to keep his word, and yetâ"if he could just see her! So the days passed. He had gladdened his eyes three times with a view of old General Bartholomew. He had seen that ancient man leaning on his stick, taking a constitutional around the square. He had no right to enquire, no right to hunt her down. Another disappointment. He had made his aimless way back to the West End of London. "Alston." "I will say good-bye, Mr. Alston, and go after my friend." "No, waitâ"wait. I want to speak to you, to thank you." "For speaking to me." She laughed sharply. "Mr. Alston, do you realise that I am very angry with myself?" she said coldly. "No, Iâ"" She flushed suddenly. To deny, was unworthy of her. "Yes, I remember." "It is true, remember what I said. It is true, and will remain true all my life." And now for the first time he noticed that she was not dressed as he had seen her last. she said bitterly. "I remembered my promise made to you at General Bartholomew's, yet I came to London in the hope of seeing you, that was all that brought me here. she said angrily. I am sorry I spoke to you. "I think you know that I will not annoy you. She looked at him keenly. she said quietly. "Why?" He had not known, then. "It is all strange and curious. Joan cried. "I suggest Prince's," he said. "But I do, my dear. I am simply famished," said Helen. "You can't refuse now, Joan," Hugh said. "As you like," Joan said indifferently. She looked at Hugh resentfully. "I am sorry, butâ"but I couldn't let you go yet. he stammered. She promised herself that, and she did. But she kept the worst sting for the last. he said, as the waiter went his way, and his voice was shocked and hurt. He had only meant to be frank with her. he said, so that she alone could hear, and then he was gone, and Helen looked after him. Marjorie did not answer. "Well, you can see me if that's all you have come for." he said. "Oh, sit down!" "Well, now what is it you want? "No, no!" "I am come on a matter that interests me greatly. I am a financier, I have offices in London. "Her name was Meredyth, Miss Joan Meredyth." "Why you come to me, goodness only knows. If you want information, the right person to go to is her husband!" "You seem surprised," said Lady Linden. "Well, so was I, but it is the truth. If you are interested in Miss Meredyth, the proper person to make enquiries of is Mr. Hugh Alston, of Hurst Dormer, Sussex. "But what?" she said. He had been making discreet enquiries, and he found on every side that her ladyship's story was corroborated. He felt satisfied; he had discovered all that was discoverable, so far as Cornbridge was concerned. She may have said she was, but she wasn't!" He chuckled grimly. "I think so. "I will go and look up my books." "Mr. Alston, I remember the name. I am not sure, Mr. Alston certainly called several times." "I think not. It is quite possible." He had found out all that he wanted to know, yet not quite. He went to the church and looked up the register. He had never taken Ellice with him since that first time. "Yes, dear; well, if you thinkâ"" She hesitated. "Oh, there isn't much room there!" "Joan Meredyth," he repeated, and she saw a deep flush come stealing under the tan of his cheeks. "Oh, she's handsome, Con. "Yes, and do youâ"" "And do I admire her? Yes, I do, but I could wish she was just a little less cold, a little less stately, Con." "Oh, a good deal!" "Yes, a little; she thinks a great deal of her. He had picked up a small secondhand car, which he strenuously learned to drive, and thereafter the little car might have been seen plugging almost daily along the six odd miles of road that separated Buddesby from Starden. But she saw it all in her quiet way, and was anxious and worried, as a kindly, gentle, tender-hearted woman must be when she notices one of her own sex give all the love of a passionate heart to one who neither realises nor desires it. To her he had become "Johnny," to him she was "Joan." She laughed. She nodded. She looked at him with sweet seriousness. he said, and his voice shook with sudden feeling, and into his face there came a wave of colour. "A gentleman in the drawing-room, miss, to see you," the girl said. "A gentleman to see me? "He would not give a name, miss. Yet it was someone waiting, someone here. "I will wait till you come back, Joan." She stared at him in amaze, almost doubting the evidence of her sight. "Uninvited," she said. he shouted suddenly. "You can stow that kind of talk with me!" "You came here believing, I suppose, that I was practically friendless. He went to the window wonderingly. Another thing that Slotman noticed about him was that he was not Mr. Hugh Alston, whom he remembered perfectly. He looked her in the eyes. "But it won't come off, Joan; no, my dear, I've been too busy of late to be taken in by your airs and defiance!" He laughed. A nice little town, quiet though. Why do you come here to me with all these statements? Why do you come here at all?" He laughed. "Mr. "You can guess, can't you, Joany?" he said. "I am not attempting to guess. You were only a girl, straight out of school. she whispered. Oh no, you didn't go! She did understand, a sense of horror came to her, horror and shame that this man should dareâ"dare to think evil of her! If you ever dare to return I will have you flung outâ"you hear me? he said. He laughed in her face. He had seen something like it on the stage at some time. He paused. "I'll write," he thought. He looked at her. "Good-bye, Joan. Meanwhile, rememberâ"not a word, not a word to a living soul. Meanwhile Johnny Everard wandered about the sweet, old-world garden, and did not appreciate its beauties in the least. said Johnny. The sun seemed to shine less brightly for him for a few moments. "I'm sorry. she whispered. Why, why, why?" No, she could not. Yet she must have protection from this man, this Slotman. He had an intense love for the home of his birth and his boyhood, but just now it seemed to mean less to him than it ever had before. But she was always there. I know her to be all these, and yetâ"" "Lady Linden, sir, and Miss Marjorie Linden!" she said. said Hugh, and kissed her, and so the feud between them was ended. How are you, Marjorie?" I knew it was a cat, a mountain or a coffin that one usually associates with Mahomed. "Renovations." "Yes, I believeâ"" "Then go and get a suitcase packed, and come back with us to Cornbridge." He would not hear of it at first; but Lady Linden had made up her mind, and she was a masterful woman. Marjorie, go out into the garden and smell the flowers. she repeated, when the girl had gone out. "Look here, I know what is in your mind; if I come, it will be on one condition!" Very well, I agree; we won't mention it. "I am no longer interested in theâ"young woman. "Very good, sir!" He had not even the courtesy to answer her letter, in which she had pleaded for a meeting. But she was a woman. Joan, it is a week or more since Johnny was here." "Yes, about a week I think," said Joan indifferently. Helen looked at her. Yes, she was fond of Johnny, and she had grown very fond of late of this girl. She looked under the somewhat cold surface, and she recognised a warm, a tender and a loving nature, that had been suppressed for lack of something on which to lavish that wealth of tenderness that she held stored up in her heart. But she hoped for Johnny. said Joan heartily. She went on reading steadily, her lips compressed, her face hard and bitter. "I think," she said, "I think of the two I despise him the more. "I wanted him to come with us this afternoon, but he could not. It is the hops!" "Of course!" Joan said. Yes, she would send the money. "I think she is worried about something," Connie thought. "I want to show you something in the garden, Connie," she said. "I am certain of it!" Joan said suddenly. She laughed sharply when Joan had gone out. "If he were here, it would be different. "I cannot confide in her. said Tom. Marjorie had suffered, and was suffering. Perhaps Tom, anxious to propitiate Lady Linden, had been a little more servile than usual. He did not mean to be servile. If you want toâ"to keep my respect, you'll have to act like a man, a man with self-respect! cried Marjorie. said Hugh. "Look here," said Hugh, and he gripped Tom by the shoulder with such strength that Tom was surprised and a little pained. "Look here, I don't know what Marjorie is going to grow like, but I know thisâ"that she is the sweetest, most tender-hearted, dearest little soul, loyal and true and straight, and because you've won her love, my good lad, you ought to go down on your knees and thank Heaven for it. She's worth ten, fifty, a hundred of you and of me. So if you've offended the child, go after her. "Well, Iâ"hang me! Marjorie's own little ancient car had developed a serious internal complaint that had put it definitely out of commission, so there was no means of getting to Hurst Dormer unless he walked, or wired to his man to bring over his own car, but Hugh did not trouble to do that. "Look here, Alston, I don't know what the lay is," he said. I am not conscious of having offended her. he said. And now you go for me bald-headed, as if I'd behaved like a pig to her. "Marjorie dear," he was saying a while later, "what's wrong? Marjorie gasped. "There, thereâ"there!" he said, feeling as awkward as a man must feel when a woman cries to him. she gasped. "Yes, I know he is, andâ"and oh, I do know it, Hugh, and it isn't Tom's fault!" "No, it is not thatâ"oh, it is nothing, nothing in the world. "It is youâ"you are the man I love. He had never seen "Her" writing before, yet instinct told him that this was hers. "Mrs. Morrisey! "Oh, that one, sir? he said. "Oh no, not at all, nothing important!" She laughed aloud and bitterly at her own thoughts. "Yes," she repeated to herself, "I hate him. "I am sure that there never was anything between Joan and that Hugh Alston. I know he loves her." "Yes, Iâ"" He fumbled nervously with his hands. "Yes, dear?" "I think," Helen said, "that Joan would like you the better and admire you the more for being brave enough to speak out." "That's it! "I do, dear." Look at me, a great ugly chapâ"how could such a girl care for me?" "I think any girl might very easily care for you, Johnny!" I am nothing more, Helen, andâ"andâ"" "Johnny, she is in the garden. "I can but lose, eh? But, by Heaven! if I do lose, it is going toâ"to hurt, and hurt badly. So for one long moment they looked at one another, and the colour rose in the girl's cheeks, and into her eyes there came a wistful regret. He felt tongue-tied, more than usually awkward, terribly and shamefully nervous. Oh, it was worth fighting for, worth taking his courage in both hands for, this girl with the sweet, serious face and the tender mouth, the great, enquiring, yet trusting grey eyes. He had seen her cold, stately, a little unapproachable, but he had never seen scorn in those eyes. He had never seen the red lips curled with contempt. And now the girl seemed to be all woman, tender, sympathetic, and the courage came to him; he sate himself beside her and took her hand in his, and it gave him hope that she did not draw it away. "I love you, dear. I know you are high above me. I know what I am, an unlovely sort of fellow, rough andâ"and not fit to touch your handâ"" for, being deeply in love, his opinion of himself had naturally sunk to zero. "Just to tell you thatâ"to tell you how I love you, Joan." Another man had told her that; the echo of his words came back to her from the past. Yet she told herself that she hated him who had uttered them, hated him, for was he not a proved craven? And now another, a worthier, better man, was telling her the same story, holding her hand, and, she knew, looking into her face; yet her eyes did not meet his. I know all that, I know that you are a good man, Johnny. I know that; but oh, I do not love you!" I am a foolish, dense fellow, dear, and I don't understand!" "It must. "I glory in it. "I glory in it. "You can see how disappointed he looks, poor fellow." See, he's going now. "Oh no, I think that must be she. As he turned to leave, she came, and they met face to face. "But icily cold. "Yes," she said, "youâ"you were a long time answering." "So I went, and no letters were forwarded. Yes, I am glad to feel the neglect was not intentional." She started a little at the sound of her name, but did not look at him. Yes, I think I acted meanly; it was a thing a woman would do. Yes, I am ashamed by the smallness of it. He nodded. he asked, "or coffee?" He smiled at the thought of those dreams, so utterly broken and dead and wafted away into the nothingness of which they had been built. "You sent for me to help you?" "I wanted your help. You wrote that," he said. I do not ask you to tell me why you did itâ"it was cruel and mean, unmanly; but you did it. But she did not answer immediately, for the answer would be difficult. I do not ask why you uttered it. He did not understandâ"how should he? He went down to Marlbury and to Morchester to make enquiries, to look for an entry in a register that was never made. He went to General Bartholomew and then Cornbridge, where he saw Lady Linden, and heard from her all that she had to tell, and thenâ"then he came to me. I hesitated, and did not know what to do. "Oh, that Iâ"" "Remember," she said, "remember I had written to you, asking your help. I had waited days, and no answer had come. I love you nowâ"my love for you gives me the right to protect you!" I asked you to marry me once. He laughed bitterly. "You refused with scorn, just scorn, Joan. "You cannot!" she said quietly. "You cannot, and if you should, the answer will be the same, as then!" She did not answer. he asked quietly. "He's a man," she cried, "a man who would not make a jest of a woman's name." You do not love that man, because you love me!" I do not. I despise you. he said. He would have followed her, but then came the waiter with his bill, and he was forced to stay, and when he reached the street she was gone. "I think that they do not know their own minds, young people seldom do. "A gentleman to see you, sir. "You can go!" to the boy, who hesitated. said Hughâ""very, so I hear." "That's what I am here for; to dare. I want that moneyâ"and more; I want a declaration from you that you will never molest her again; for if you doâ"if you doâ"" Hugh's face was not good to see, and Mr. Slotman quivered uneasily in his chair. He paused. I asked her to be my wife, no man could do more, no man could act more honourably. "I cannot force your belief." "Hers and yours," Slotman said boldly. Helen asked no more questions. Joan said calmly. "Of course," Helen hesitated, "the marriage need not be long delayed. "I am sure of that." Joan rose. She went out into the garden. She went to the bench beside the pool and sat there, staring at the green water. A deep flush stole into her cheeks, and then died out. "It is a lie! I want to seeâ"her!" "Why?" "I want to see her," the girl said. "I want to see her. She laughed shrilly. I want to see her again, the woman that he loves." I know, but I am going. she said resignedly. "I want to see her again. I want toâ"to understand, toâ"to know things." "I want to watch her!" "I think you are acting foolishly and wrongly, Ellice. "I am coming with you," Ellice said. Come, there are lots of things to see. Joan said. "Now let us talk of you and Johnny, Joan, of the future. Yes." "In three months' time then, Joan." "In three months' time then," she said. The sun was down, but the twilight lingered. "But why so excited about it, little girl?" "No, aunt." And now I will tell you what he suggests about Partridge's cottage and land when the lease falls in." If not, where was he? and if not. "I think it would be very nice!" But I was wrong, and you are right. I see it now. He is not quite a fool, but you are. Meanwhile, Marjorie had hurried out. He had wanted her for his wife, and sheâ"she in her blindness and her folly, in her stupidity, which her aunt had but now been flinging in her teeth, had not realised that he was the one man in her world, the only man, and that she loved him as never, never could she love Tom Arundel or anyone else. Marjorie started it. "It is my fault," she felt miserably; "it is all my fault, and I am not fair to Tom. I love Hugh!" "He does not love me now, not as he did. And now, seeing Marjorie here, pouring out the tea, the only vision, the only remembrance that it brought to him was the memory of another girl pouring out tea in a London hotel. "Yes, dear," he said simply, for why should he lie to this child? she said. "Joan Meredyth," he said slowly, "and I met in Town a few days ago. She told me then, that she is engaged to be married." Marjorie said, and her heart leaped with a new-born hope. she said. "No, it is mine. But that does not matter so much. He smiled at her, little dreaming that she had only won dead-sea fruit. "I am not going to tell you, dear. Besides, you couldn't help. "Yes," she said miserably. "He's a good fellow, Marjorie. he added, and put his hand on her shoulder, and did not notice that she was weeping silently. "But I gave you up because you loved another man; you loved a man more worthy than I am. Stick to him, don't ask for too much. He kissed her frankly as a brother might, and sat there watching her up the drive to the house. He did not guess that when she gained the house she slipped in by a garden door and ran up to her own room to indulge in that relief that a woman may ever find when the grief is not too black and too bitter, the relief of tears. "Mrs. Morrisey, I am going to London." "Oh, Mr. Alston, when the men areâ"" "The men are all right. "I see. Very good, sir. "Very good, sir. Yes, he must go to London. he added, with cheerful decision. I know she cannot love." Oh, fool! Cheer yourself up, slap yourself on the back. She may love you as you boast, but she'll never marry you. And now he was in the train for London. He walked down the wide pavement till he came to the familiar door. "I'll see him," he thought. He went up the stone steps and paused. "Whyâ"whyâ"why?" Why should this woman who did not love him wish to take him away from her, who worshipped the ground he trod on, who looked up to him as the best, the finest of all God's created creatures? Perhaps she looks on me only as a childâ"a silly, foolish, infatuated child. I am not!" "I am not! I love him. "Send her away. How old is she, sixteen?" She loves him so, and I know it. He did not see what Connie sawâ"the heaviness about those eyes, the suggestion of tears during the night, when she came down silently to her breakfast. And now there seemed to be a bond between them that drew them closer. "Yes, darling?" "I want you to understand, Connie, that Iâ"I promise you I will do nothingâ"nothing, I will never do anything unless I come to you first and tell you. Another moment and the girl was in her arms, clasping her passionately, and kissing her passionately and gratefully. He shuddered. "Why?" He wouldn't do nothing to save Snatcher, miss. He had refused definitely and decidedly. Alston." "I am sure it must be in the best taste. "Oh, then Mr. Roger died at sea and left it all, Starden Hall and his money, to Miss Joan Meredyth. "To Mr. John Everard of Buddesby, a rare pleasant-spoken, nice gentleman as no one can speak a word against. The roof was clad with Sussex stone, lichen-covered, and a feast of colour from grey and vivid yellow to the most tender green. Yet here he was. He had gazed on the slim grace of her figure, himself hidden behind Mrs. Bonner's spotless white lace curtains. He had watched her, his soul in his eyes, the woman he loved and who was not for him, could never be for him now, and there fell upon him a sense of desolation, of loneliness, of utter hopelessness. He had seen Joan twice, he had seen the man she was to marry. "He seems all right." Come out for a spinâ"the car's running finely to-day. Come out, and we'll go and have lunch at Langbourne or somewhere. He went to the village because, if he went in the opposite direction, it would take him to the Hall gates, and he did not wish to go there. He did not wish her to see him, to form the idea that he was here loitering about for the purpose of seeing her. He smiled, having no idea where Little Langbourne might be. "Yes, at Mrs. "Oh, then you are an artist?" "Yes, but I am a patient animal. "I am not offended. Why should I be? I am a girl andâ"and not very big, am I?" "I think you are generous." She laughed and turned to get the bicycle. If you have a spannerâ"" "I haven't," said Ellice. He had seen her, had paused. He had his foot on the clutch and was feeling for the brake when Joan realised his intention. Another moment, and Joan regretted. "I think you know her," she said quickly. "Yes, Iâ"I know her." he laughed, but the laughter was shaky. Perhaps they were old lovers, perhaps a thousand things? "I think," he said, "that we shall often meet again." So Joan had seen him, and had cut him dead. But that was folly; they had cut her, but then in this matter she had not counted. "Joan Meredyth knows that man, and he knows her." "Fine, missy!" he said. I'll watch out for that man, missy." "Tell me about Snatcher!" "To Mr. Vinston, you mean!" "To you. He wouldn't 'a come for me, nor Snatcher; he hates my poor tyke. After it, Joan left him with Helen and went to her own room. She took it out and gave it to a gardener's boy. If he is not there, bring it back to me." "Yes, miss." "That's all right, thanks!" "I am sorryâ"for what I did.... He felt in his pocket for the coin that the Starden children had grown to expect from him. "But the fact remains," said Hugh to himself, "there is no sense in deliberately riding for a fall. he said. "That's nothing! "I am new to it, and I am always doing odd things like that. He looked at the man standing but a few feet from him, the man who was to gain that which Hugh coveted and desired most in the world, looked at him and yet felt no dislike, no great enmity, no furious hate. He nodded, smiled, and walked on, then glanced back. "That's my hated rival, and he seems a decent sort of chap." How well he remembered that scent! "Dear little maid," he said. "So unhappy, so wretched!" He had just time to write and catch the early outward mail from Starden, to-day was Thursday. He rang the bell for Mrs. Bonner. "Oh, good evening, Mrs. Bonner. "Yes, it's me!" "Well, what do you want, Alice Betts?" "Oh, nothing. "Very good of you, only I'm busy cleaning up." "Nor should I. I wonder what he is to her, don't you?" "Well, any'ow he's gone," she said, and Mrs. Bonner did not contradict her. "Depend on it, it was the letter done it. Well, I won't be keeping you." Give me a paper and envelope," she demanded. He had wired Mrs. Morrisey, and now he was back. "Oh, Hugh, it is so good to see you again." He kissed her. He rang the bell for tea, for it was tea-time when she came. "Oh, Hugh, ifâ"if you knew howâ"how good it is to see you again and hear you speak to me." "It is always good to me to see you," he said softly. And now came Phipps with the tea, which he arranged on the small table and retired. "Oh, Hugh, not now. It is so difficult, almost impossible to tell you. "Why?" "How?" the girl gasped. "Whyâ"youâ"Iâ"I thoughtâ"" "So did I!" It is my fault, not Tom's; he is good and kind andâ"and patient with me, and I know I am unkind and cross to him, and I feel ashamed of myself!" "Marjorie!" "Yes, Hugh?" She looked up. "Tell me the truth, dear," he said gravely. She did not answer in words, nodding speechlessly. "That's bad!" "But I might have guessed that she would say that, bless her little heart! He sighed. I am not of much use, I am afraid; but such as I am, I am at your service, dear, always, always! "No, oh no, you must not!" Marjorie, does he know? she lives there. Yet she knew that she could not do that; her pride forbade. But she did not love him. He had not answered the letter she had sent him a couple of days ago. She went to her own room, where was her private writing-table. "You need not go, Alice," she said. "Then youâ"you mean he is gone?" "Thursday night, miss." "So you did come?" "Certainly not!" "Oh, very well!" He felt savagely angry at her calmness, at her pride and superiority. It is money, of course?" "Look here, stow that!" he said coarsely. I know who you are and what you are, andâ"and don'tâ"don't"â"he was stuttering and stammering in his rageâ""don't think you can put me in my place, because you can't!" Joan did not answer. And I do. He had expected that she might struggle; it would have been human if she had, but she didn't. "Tell me why you wish to see me!" "Well, if you want to know, it is money, and this time it is good money. He laughed. "So you have seen him?" "I saw him, curse him! he almost shouted. "Oh, you won'tâ"you won't! "It is true! "It is not!" He laughed. I know that I need not believe you, soâ"so I shall consider. "Oh, you will?" "In a few days, this day week, not before." she said calmly. She looked at him shrewdly. Marjorie welcomed him with tearful gladness in her eyes. "I felt you would," she said. Tom looked up. Alston, youâ"you've seen her. I know that I am not a manâ"like you, a man a girl could look up to and respect, but I've always loved her, Hugh, and I've kept straight. "Oh, my Lord! "Mrs. Morrisey, I am going to London." "Very good, sir!" "Very good, sir!" "Certainly, sir!" I know she is lovely; she is good, she is rich, and she is coldâ"cold to Johnny. But, all the same, I am sorry you are opposed to the marriage." "But it does. "How?" "With Joan. "Whyâ"why?" he stammered. Oh, Johnny, I am anxious, very anxious. he said reverently. Your own heart starved, can you continue to love and give again and again? "Why?" Oh, I have watched her. He went to her, put his arm about her, and held her tightly and kissed her. "Gipsy girl," he said, "come with me. she said coldly. He walked away slowly and dejectedly, and the girl watched him. He felt a clutch on his arm, and turned. He did not answer. "Why, Gipsy girl!" he said slowly, "you are a womanâ"you have grown up all suddenly." "Yes, I amâ"I am a woman!" She laughed, but the laughter ended in a sob. He had thought her a child; but she was a woman, and he had seen in her eyes that which set his dull wits wondering. yes. "A man," she concluded, "as I wouldn't trust, not a hinch!" "I see. "I see," Hugh repeated. I want you to take this letter to her; tell no one at the Hall that the letter is from me, tell no one that I am back. "You can, sir!" "I am sure of it. "Oh, good evening, Mrs. Anyhow, I'm here to see your mistress. You go and tell her I am here." She dropped a curtsey. "You want to see me?" "Yes, miss, but firstâ"excuse me, miss!" If I might make so bold, miss, I'd get rid of her. But I must see you. "Yes, miss, came back only about a hour ago, and he's waiting there. "Yes, I understand. Tell himâ"I shall comeâ"presently. Tell him I am grateful to him for coming so quickly." He looked at her standing before him. "I sent for you, Hugh." "You sent for me, dear?" I want your advice, perhaps your help. I knew that man would come. He needs money, there is the magnet of your gold. "And Iâ"I cut you in the street, Hugh." "And hurt yourself by doing it," he said softly. "Yes." It is true." "Tell me, have you seen this man?" "Yes, last Saturday. "Gipsy, we must go back," he said. And now in the dusk of the evening they set off on the homeward journey. She laughed. she repeated. Why should Joan have been at Mrs. Bonner's cottage at such an hour? Why should she have been there talking to the very man whom she had a week ago cut dead in the village? "In any case, I am not worthy of her. It is all right!" And now Connie was gone to bed, and Ellice too; and Johnny smoked his pipe and frowned over it, and asked himself questions to which he could find no answer. "But I trust her, absolutely," he said aloud. He had never realised how little she was till he saw her now, standing there with her bare feet and a thin white dressing-gown over her nightdress, her hair hanging in great waving tresses about her oval face and shoulders and far down her back. She looked such a childâ"and yet such a woman, her great eyes anxiously on his face. He nodded, speechless. "Why, Johnny?" I know she is fine and honourable and true and straight, and you must know that too, soâ"so why should you worry, Johnny? Why should you worry?" Why do you come to tell me this, Gipsy?" He had risen, he stood looking at herâ"such a little thing, so graceful, so lovely with the colour in her cheeks, the light in her eyes, the light of her fine generosity. She laughed shortly. I always have for years. I always wait for that!" "Gipsy, whyâ"why should you?" "Gipsy, wait. she said, and looked at him. I am not worthy of that! I am not worthy of that!" Muria. He had not the smallest doubt but that she would come. And now she was coming. I want to speak to you about something else." "Yes, do you think I always put money first?" "I had thought so, Mr. you must listen!" He had gripped her arm and held tightly, and as before she did not struggle nor try to win free of him. And now she wrenched herself free. "Soâ"so that is it, is it? I am impossible, am I?" "Soâ"so that's the talk, is it?" "That's it, is it? "You!" he gasped, "what are you? We will talk in thousands, my girl. he shouted, "and money it shall be! Money, yes! I want ten thousand pounds! Not five, remember, but ten, and perhaps more to follow. "Aâ"a trap," he gasped. Joan, go. Yet she did not. No, she would not ask for mercy for him: Hugh Alston was just. "So you refused to accept my warning, Slotman?" he said, "blackmailer!" It is a pity the duel has gone out, not that you would have fought me with a sword or pistol, Slotman, stillâ"Yes, it must be the thrashing." "If I touch you, what?" Look at me, am I not always busy? "Yes, my lady?" Curtis, under-gardener, trudged away with a large healthy worm dangling from thumb and forefinger, a sheepish grin on his face. Curtis, come back; there is another worm." Marjorie stood at the window, watching her aunt's operations, yet seeing none of them. Butâ"I am sorry. "I want to speak to you." "Then you might turn and look at a chap, Marjorie." "Tell me, sweetheart, then," he saidâ""tell me in your own way, what is it? "It is very serious, Tom." "Yes, dear, then it is serious." But she was. he said, and his voice was strangely quiet. "Oh, Tom, I believed I did. It is Iâ"Iâ"who am to blame, not you. I was foolish and weak. He looked down at his hands, grimed with the work he had been at; he smiled, but there was no mirth in his smile. He looked at the unyielding little figure against the light, and in his eyes was a great longing and a subdued passion. "I want it to be." "Yes, I understand. I knew that I was not good enough, never good enough for youâ"far, far beneath you, dear. Perhaps I was a fool to think I could. I know now that I could not." "Tom, I am sorry," she said. "I am sorry." And now it is gone, and can never come back again. How well he had taken it! How well, and yet he loved her! "I am fickle, I am false. I do not know my own mind, andâ"and I have hurt him. I am not worthy of hurting him. He had news for her, something that must be told; gone was his accustomed terror of her ladyship. He had taken it so well; he had risen to a height she had not suspected him capable of, and the fault was hers, hers. "I am not going to. I want to helpâ"him." "It is true. He had wired back that he was on his way; no man could do more. She waited outside in the big hall, her eyes on the stairs, her ears tensioned to every sound from above, and at every sound she started. She looked in vain for something that would whisper the word "Hope" to her. He had suffered, and someone should payâ"Joan mainly, after Joan, Hugh Alston. Yes, Joan would be the one. He would make her pay; he would hurt Alston through her, and hit her hard at the same time. He would stay here at Little Langbourne. "Buddesby, sir?" "Yes, sir. He would go. "Is this Buddesby, my man? Those gates, are they the gates of Buddesby?" "Aye, they be," said the man. he said slowly, "oh, so 'tis 'ee, be it? "I remember 'ee, I do. He looked swiftly up the road and down it, and Slotman saw the action and quivered. he shouted. He had not seen Joan since that night when, with Ellice beside him, he had seen her and the man at the door of Mrs. Bonner's cottage. He had meant to go, but had not gone. He had never missed spending a Sunday with them since the engagement; and yet he felt loath to go, and did not know why. He had seen Connie off to Church. He had pictured her again and again to himselfâ"a little, white-clad, barefooted figure standing against the dusky background of the hallway, framed by the open door. He had kissed Joan's cold cheek, he had kissed her hand, but her lips had not been for him. He had wondered once if they ever would be, and he had cared a great deal; now he ceased to wonder. "So youâ"you didn't go to Church, Gipsy?" "No. "But they expect you." "Soâ"so come with me, Gipsy girl." "After all, after all," the girl was thinking. "Always, always," she said. "I will do nothing, nothing, Con, unless I tell you first." "Well, Ellice, have you anything to say to me?" "Yes," Ellice said. "To seeâ"her?" "Whyâ"why, darling, why?" "Why?" Helen asked. I want to be alone with him for some time." "Of course, darling." "He is walking. He had come at last. A servant shewed him in. he said briefly. I am not proud of it." "Forâ"for you." Why should you? "I cannot," she said. "It is useless, Hugh. he said. My Joan, do you love me?" "He is busy." Helen looked down on Ellice as a person of no importance, who was entirely unwanted, a mere nuisance, someone for ever in the way. She did not like her. "So you wish to see Joan, why?" "Privately." "Well, at any rate you cannot see her now. "I can wait." Helen looked at her. Your own true, sweet self." A servant let him out, and then the servant came back to her. But no, Joan held out a hand in greeting to her. "To see me?" "Yes, youâ"you do. If you loved himâ"but you don'tâ"you don't! It is part of his life. "Yes, you haveâ"you have much more. Is that it, Ellice?" Oh, it is not fair!" "It is not fair," Joan said; "it is not fair, and yet I thought of that. And now Joan's eyes flamed, the anger came back. "It is only what I believed. Tell him what I have told you, tell himâ"if there is someone else, if you have already met someone you care forâ"tell him that too, so that he will know how impossible it must ever be that you will give him the love he hoped to win. Tell him that, be frank and truthful. Joan said softly. "You love him, Ellice?" "I think it is," Joan said. "But then, dear, if he loves me, he could not love you?" "I think he might," Ellice said softly. "I think he might," her heart echoed. "I think he might, in time, in a little time." "So you came to me to tell me. "I had to come. "But I have given him my promise, Ellice." "I thinkâ"yes, I think I shall do all this, Ellice," she said. I was thinking. "Who?" "A man, aâ"aâ"gentleman, I suppose. He looks as if he has been drinking, though." "Slotman." Wait, I'll light the lamp. "I think she went towards Starden." Show him in, Con." "Mr. "Yes, you are Mr. He walked stiffly, he carried his right arm stiffly. "It is private and personal, my business with you. "I think it will be better if you go," he said quietly. "I had to tell you in spite of yourself, and it is true. It is true. If you don't goâ"" Slotman glanced at him; he saw that he was over-stepping the danger-line. Yes, he must go, and quickly, so he went. He had forced this man to hear, even though he would not listen. no, I ain't done yet. He had not carried out his intention in full, this man had not given him time. He looked up. said Johnny, and sprang up. I want that money. If you like to pay her debt, I will guarantee silence. And now for the first time he looked back, and as he did so a blinding white glare seemed to strike his eyes; he staggered, and tried to spring aside. He had left behind him a world of darkness and of pain, a curiously jumbled unreal world, in which it seemed to him that he had played the part of a thing that was being dragged by unseen hands in a direction that he knew he must not go, a direction against which he fought with all his strength. And now he lay, wide-eyed in the sunshine, and the blackness and chaos were gone, but he could still see the hands, for one of them was clasped in his own, and lifting his eyes he saw the face that he knew must be thereâ"a pale face, thinner than when he had seen it last, a face that had lost some of its childish prettiness. "Marjorie," he said, and the weakness of his own voice surprised him, and he lay wondering if it were he who had spoken. So for a long time he lay, his breath gentle and regular, the small hand clasped in his own. And now he was away in dreams, not the black and terrifying dreams of just now, but dreams of peace and of a happiness that might never be. "Marjorie," he whispered, "you told meâ"" "I told you what was not true, but I thought it wasâ"oh, I believed it was, dear. "No, no!" she said. Perhaps I did think it, but oh, Tom, I was not worth it! "You were talking. "Yes." "Aunt, I shall not leave him." "Jordan," said Lady Linden, "you are an old man." "Not so wonderful old, my lady." "Jordan, we are both old, but we must move with the times. "Marjorie, is it only pity?" he whispered. But she shook her head. "It is love, all my loveâ"I know now. It is all ended. I know the truth. "Gipsy is right, she always is," he thought. Oh, these people!" "It is a long time since I saw you, Johnnyâ"four or five days, isn't it?" Joan said. She held out her hand to him, and he took it. She too saw it, but it did not disturb her as it did Helen. He had come to tell her something, Joan felt. So for a few minutes they fenced, and then it was he who broke away. "I think, Johnny, you have something to say to me." Then he came back. He had remembered what his errand wasâ"blackmail. He had reached the window, and stood staring out into the garden, yet seeing nothing of its beauty. she said. She stared. "No. "Of course not!" She waited, listening expectantly for his answer. "I am not generous. Yet it should have been so simple, so ample an answer to her question. I was frank and open to you then, was I not?" "You always are." "I think I did." "You were giving so much and asking for so little in return. You do not ask me to deny them, dear, and so I won't. Yet, behind those lies, there was a little truth. And nowâ"now I have something more to tell you. It is this. "Tell me," he said. It is for you to decide, and no one else. "No, it isn't," he admitted. "Yes, she did. If you loved him, and he loved you, I would not come to you; but you do not love him, and it is not fair. And, she was right!" Then he turned to her, and it seemed as if the cloud had lifted from him. "Friends, always, Johnny," she said. "Friends always, then." "Tell me about that man, Johnny," she said. "Why?" "To see him." he whispered. She nodded and smiled. "Of course. you must not talk. But she was here, she knew and she forgave, and there was comfort in her presence. I want to help you, all the past is past. I knew about that night, about your visit. Now, hush for the Matron is coming." He had been her enemy, and yet perhaps in his way, a bad and vile way, selfish and dishonourable, he had loved her; but as she had said, all that was of the past. "I saw you just now. "To the hospital. She went to see that fellow, Con." "Utterly. "It is ended," he said quietlyâ""our engagement. "I will wait here for her, for Gipsy," he said. "Send her here to me, and I will tell her, Con." And now, because his eyes were widely opened at last, he could see the tell-tale flush in her cheeks, the suspicious brightness in her eyes, and it seemed to him that her love for him was as a magnet that drew his heart towards her. She nodded silently. He had gone. "Yes, miss. He had gone when he might have stayedâ"when, had he been here now, she would have told him that she was free. "Thenâ"then, after all, it is over?
