 Yes,â"but not his: 'Tis death itself there dies. But without further preface, I proceed to the narrative. In previous cases of deep, personal interest, this has been unnecessary. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Instead of fear and dread, peace came with it. Now I know that I am to die, I feel less nervous. She expressed some natural apprehensions, only, about the possibility of dissolution not having occurred when we should suppose that she was no more. "I love the white flowers," said she. In her whispering voice, which disease had for some time so nearly hushed, she said, "I shall sing in heaven." "Some people," she said, "wish to die in order to get rid of pain. What a motive! I said, "Would you exchange conditions with her?" "Not for ten thousand worlds," was her energetic reply. Sabbath afternoon, the mortal conflict was upon her. "How long," said she, "will it probably continue?" The nurse was with her alone, and at her side, the family being at the table. I said, "You know Jesus." We rejoiced, and wept for joy. I then said, "If you know father, press my hand." It survives, or I would not, I could not, write thus. Jesus of Nazareth has been in my dwelling, and has done a great work of healing. Then what will she herself be, when these eyes behold her again? In her very early childhood, she and two of the children were sick with a children's epidemic. This daughter was singing, and the chorus of her little school song was, "All are here, all are here." She bequeathed her guitar, but her voice and hand now join with "the voice of harpers harping with their harps." What a perpetual spring tide of vivacious joy and delight do they create in heaven. When the cry was made, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh," she arose and trimmed her lamp, and had oil in her vessel with her lamp. "My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live." Parents, you will need him for your children. When the name of father, cannot rouse you, nor your cold hand return the pressure of your father's hand, you will need a nearer, dearer friend, in the person of Him who loved you, and gave himself for you. Instead of abandoning ourselves to grief, we do well if we commune with God more frequently respecting his signal acts of favor in connection with the lost blessing. If we love him more than we love his gifts, then the removal of them will make us love him more than ever. It terminates in the relations of governor and of judge; being, indeed, from the first, included in those relations. Do not let the world, or shame, or procrastination, lead you to resist such efforts of almighty love to save you. I go to it reluctantly. Happy, happy man! In doing so, they were sometimes obliged to pass through dark, lonely valleys. We cannot stay here forever; we are to go, presently, beyond the mountains; they say that there are valleys, in those regions, full of dangers. My expectation is, that we shall be torn to pieces. When the sheep had fallen into the power of a beast, the crook assisted in drawing him away. A good sheep loved the crook as much as the staff,â"to be guided, as well as to be defended. If it were the only lamb of its mother, it was natural for that mother to be distressed, and to lament. The fear of death is owing, in many cases, to the dread of dissolution. To die will not beâ"as in full health we suppose it isâ"a violent rending asunder of the soul from the unyielding grasp of the body; but the preparation of the mortal frame for dissolution, by the sickness, however rapid, also fits the mind for the event. Even in cases of death by accidents, this appears to be true. We cannot believe that such is the experience of dying Christians. they whisper; angels say, Sister spirit, come away." The same care which has redeemed and saved him, will order all these things in covenanted love. Thou shall gain, As thou risest, stronger sight. O, I cannot bear this glory! And if this be so, as it surely is, why may not Christians in this world before they die, nay, from the first hour of justification by faith in Christ, triumph thus in him? Of the two who were excepted, neither of them was his only begotten Son. If he must find the grave, there will I be buried. We would not go to heaven but in the way which prophets, apostles, martyrs trod. If we suffer great pain, we cannot suffer more than Christ suffered on our account. "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him." "If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together." When the Saviour, who says, "I have the keys ofâ"death," i.e., no one can die but at the time and manner prescribed by me, takes us out of the world, it is to finish the work of our personal salvation. You saw how it was received here, at its entrance into the world. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also." We read, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints." Great interests are involved in his death, beyond his own personal welfare. Now, if we have lived for God, he will make our death the object of his especial care, and will honor it by its being the means of promoting his glory. Instead, therefore, of gloomy apprehensions as to dying, we should cherish the noble wish and aim that Christ may be magnified in our body, whether it be by life or by death. If our life has been a walking with God, "Thou art with me" will be a perfect warrant, now, and in death, to "fear no evil." No bliss mid worldly crowds is bred, Like musing on the sainted dead. We seek in vain, on earth, for one who has gone to heaven. Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off, when Elijah and Elisha stood by the Jordan. They were not persuaded that he had gone to heaven, no more to return; they sought leave to seek him, and to recover him: "Peradventure," they said, "the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley." They were importunate; and when, at last, it would, perhaps, seem like obstinacy in him, or like jealousy of their superior love for Elijah, to forbid the search, which at the worst would only be fruitless, he yielded. When they came again to Elisha, "he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?" We cannot become accustomed at once, nor for a long time, to the absence of our friend. and must not he return and abide, like them? No, he is gone to heaven. Even the earthly house of his tabernacle is dissolved; that part of him which was all of which we were cognizant by our senses, is no more. "Did I not say unto you, Go not?" But, alas! for the prophet himself, this would have been his loss, even had it proved to be their gain. But even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like him. Even the Word beholds in him an earnest of his own incarnation, resurrection, and ascension from Olivet. What a mockery Elijah's translation seems, upon that theory! No; going to heaven is not going to sleep, and going to sleep is not going to heaven. They were not the first, nor the last, whose want of faith is a marvel. Instead of departed spirits falling asleep, it is we who have a spirit of slumber. If our friends are with Christ, we must be prepared to be with him, or lose their society; and that loss will be worse than the first. To die is gain. Made perfect at thy passing, who Can sum thy added glory now?
