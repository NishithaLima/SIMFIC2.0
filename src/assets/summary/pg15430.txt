 Did you recognize him, Eleanor?" she laughed. she cried, eagerly; and with the recognition made certain the boy shut off his power, and, springing out of the car, was beside her before even the discreet coachman could draw up to the curb. "But you weren't sure," Alice finished for him. "Indeed I do," he responded. Alice asked. "And what have you been doing since?" "And now what? "And now"â"he repeated it after herâ""I want to go into business, and the pater says diplomacy for mine. To-morrow evening seemed far away to Allen, so he supplemented Mrs. Gorham's invitation by a suggestion that they take a motor ride with him the following afternoon, which brought the time of their meeting that much nearer. she remarked. "That is exactly what I ought to be," Alice said, abruptly. "You could not be his child and feel otherwise." "There is another side to all this, Alice dear, which you mustn't overlook," she said, seriously. "It is woman's part to inspire rather than to do, and the fact that it is often the more difficult rÃ´le to play perhaps makes it the nobler part, after all. "You mean that we must accept the situation as best we may and accomplish our results by proxy?" "I am so interested in it all." Covington, on the other hand, ten years Gorham's junior, was slight, though tall, and was always, in manner, speech, and dress, most carefully adjusted. Covington noted Alice's disappointment when her father cut short their interview upon her entrance, though Gorham himself was entirely oblivious to it. "I'll tell you all about it when we meet next time," he said to her in a low tone as he was leaving. "It is always an inspiration to me to talk these matters over with you." Alice asked, reproachfully. "It would have meant nothing to you," her father answered. Now tell me what has happened to-day." he asked, with interest. "Splendidly," Alice answered. "He's a big strapping fellow with the same handsome, happy face. "So Stephen wrote me." "The boy's father is the worst enemy he has. "He named me that." "Mr. "That isn't what his father calls him," laughed Gorham. "I can't tell until I see him and discover how much imagination he has." his wife queried. "Then why don't poets make business successes? The Hon. "That is, perhaps, a natural statement, Mr. Kenmore," he replied, deliberately. asked Gorham. "There are many omissions, as you would discover if you examined the list more carefully," Gorham answered; "not the least of which is the name of the Hon. Mr. "Let me save you from using so ugly a word as you have in mind, Senator. You are fully justified in having this thought suggest itself to youâ"such is the business code of morals of to-day. Gorham." "I cannot conceive it to be even within the bounds of possibility." "Absolutely." "Then how can they serve the Consolidated Companies?" "Let me explain more clearly," Gorham continued. "Here in this little book you will find the names of practically all the financial heads of the governments of the world. "I claim he has," Gorham stated. "Yes," Gorham assented, "but with a fuller appreciation that these accomplishments are not the results alone of individual ability, but far more of the exercise of the corporate power placed in its hands, not for its unlimited personal gain, but intrusted to it by law for public advantage. "Not at all. "Certainly." "Except for your unfortunate investment in the Arizona oil-wells a year ago, it might have been half a million moreâ"a loss which your fortunate connection during the past three years as a special partner in the well-known banking-house of Gilroy and Company has more than made up." Shall I give you other data?" "I will send my secretary to you to arrange the matter of taking over stock to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars in the Consolidated Companiesâ"Unlimited!" "Why, it's Riley!" Thank ye, sor, f'r remimberin' me. she continued. "Why, Allen!" Alice reproached him, "have you forgotten the motor rides you and I took with wash-tubs, turned upside down, for seats, and the remnant of your express-wagon for a steering-wheel? he admitted. "I didn't remember the freckles, either, until you spoke of them. Alice repeated, without intending to. she interrupted; "I'll run and find her." "Don't you join the opposition, Mrs. Gorham," he said, seriously. the girl asked. "Whyâ"yes," he answered. "But you must have some reason for it," she urged. "But you don't have to start in New York," Alice added. "You could make your success in some other city, and then come to New York if you wanted to." Allen became unusually thoughtful as the conversation progressed. he said; "I knew that I wanted to go into business, but I didn't realize how much there was to think over before doing it." "I can't imagine anything grander than to stand at the threshold of the world ready to enter the battle of life, to struggle with the obstacles and to conquer them. "Yes." "Yes, I guess it is grand, though it never struck me just that way before. he asked, significantly. "You men are all alike. "Don't knock; come right in. "Not a single first, to say nothing of doubtful seconds." Then, of course, the whole game is up." "Do be serious, Allen," Alice insisted. "There is absolutely no use expecting to talk business with you," the girl declared. Covington?" Allen asked, bluntly, inwardly resenting the fact that any one except her father was as intimate with Alice as the words indicated. "Better than anything else in the world." Allen became really serious. The vacuity turned into a smile, and the smile into a broad grin. "Good for you, Allen!" the girl cried, really pleased by the clumsily expressed compliment. Alice's interest in him was mingled with a disappointment that the years had not made him older and less irresponsible. Alice's serious side needed the leaven of a lighter viewpoint on life; Allen's buoyancy was already being tempered by her ambition. Alice asked again; and Mrs. Gorham, smiling quietly to herself, had answered, "Perhaps." Well, well! "There you are, daddy!" Alice released her father partially, but still held one of his hands in each of her own. "Let me see," he said, doubtfully. And I'm sure I could," she added, with confidence. "Tut, tut!" "Girls are no good, anyhow," she rebelled. Oh, why wasn't I a boy!" "Come, come." "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, dear; but business and battle are meant for men. "She's waiting for you," Alice replied, simply, looking into his face with comprehension. "She's the sweetest thing, daddy," the girl continued. "We should both be very grateful to her, dear." 'Twill do ye good, sor." But I am so thankful for it, dear. "It is experience which adds the years, my Robert; and this almost gives me the right to priority." he asked. "You amaze me," Gorham replied. "It is more than thatâ"there is the reflection of yourself in the girl's soul which demands expression." "Oh, no!" he protested. "You give me too much credit, Robert. "It is yours, none the less," Gorham insisted; "and this great corporation may be the means of giving me my son and successor, after all." "It is my hope that Alice may marry Covington," he continued, "and I see no reason why this should not be. "There seems to be no logical obstacle," Eleanor admitted; "but her heart is yet to be awakened." Now tell me something of this youngster who seems to have made quite an impression on my entire family." "I judge he isn't likely to get either from his father. "It would be unfair to judge him by yourself. "That isn't what I mean," his wife hastened to reply. "Riley," she replied. "Tell me all about it." "It is too absurd to speak of, but I was really annoyed with him for the moment. "That isn't the question. "Don't worry about Riley," she laughed. Ye lave her ter me, ma'm." "Come in," she called, innocently. he demanded. "It must have been the draught. "Shure, I ought ter know, an' I do know." "Shure, it oughter be," he declared, in despair. "Certainly, I'll try." "I didn't even know I had a 'divvle.' she cried, boldly. "Come out o' there," the old man commanded, close behind her. "It's lovely under here," the child answered; "I'd rather stay." "Come out o' there, I say." I'm tired." Allen and Alice followed close behind, ignorant of the nature of the calamity, but feeling certain by Riley's manner that it was a serious one. "No, ma'am; but she done it. "Hello, mamma Eleanor," she answered, sweetly; "is Riley after you, too?" And to get a numberâ"well, it's a joke, that's what it is." asked Alice. One of the clerks offered to help me out, and I let him. 'They have no telephone,' he said. he replied, good-naturedly. "Then he rang the central office again. "'They have no telephone,' he said. "'I really do,' I admitted. Their number is 485 Gerard, sir.' he asked me. "'If you don't, I will,' I told him. he said, 'I think that will hold her for a while, as you say in your country!' demanded Patricia, taking advantage of the first opportunity to join in the conversation. he said. "Wellâ"I suppose the strongest reasons are those which I can't put into words, Mr. Gorham, but one that seems pretty good to me is that I don't think I'm fitted for it." "Why not?" "I'm too optimistic, I think, to make a good diplomat. "Not yet, Mr. Gorham. "He was very proud of what you did at college," Gorham said. "'Allen Sanford, owner,' lost his license, but 'A. Allen asked, innocently. "No," Gorham answered; "I was thinking of something else. "I love these cozy talks," she said. "There is something about this particular hour of the night which makes anything which happens in it of the greatest importance. "All about you. "It is better for me to tell you myself." Father never realized my unhappiness. she continued, more to herself than to the girl before her. "Why not forget them, as I have tried to do?" "It is a story which I have told only once before, and I had not thought to take any one except your father into its sad confidences; but you should know it, dear. Alice's eyes were fixed upon Eleanor's face with intense interest. Alice asked. Alice asked. "But you weren't happy even at first," Alice insisted. Alice asked, sympathetically, seeing the lines deepen in Eleanor's face. "We are that already and more," Alice urged. the girl inquired, smiling. "There was a so-called club in Colorado Springs whose members included the wildest young men of the town and several of the younger ranchmen who were able to stand the pace. "Forgive me, dear Eleanor," Alice murmured. "'That's right,' he leered at her; 'that's what they teach you to do hereâ"make you hate your father, don't they? "Then he crossed the room and tore the child from my arms, in spite of her shrieks of fear and our joint efforts to stop him. Father rushed to the barn, but I was there before him. But I had not far to goâ"" The recital proved too much for Eleanor, in spite of her efforts to control herself. "No, no!" cried Alice. Alice asked, breathlessly, still further shocked by the double tragedy. she cried, involuntarily. "Yes, dear, of course I returned; but not as soon as he expected, and the shock of it all killed him. You understand, don't you? "But you said you had no friends except the man you married," Alice urged, trying to follow the narrative. "Yes, dear, you are right," Eleanor replied somewhat confused; "but one always finds friends when in trouble, you know. You must let us do that." "Yes." Alice accepted the tribute to her father as a matter of fact. "I understand," the girl cried, throwing her arms about Eleanor's neck and embracing her warmly. "I can't say the right thing now I am so unstrung, but I love you even more than ever because you've let me share it with you." "You leave that to me," his father had answered, brusquely. James." "Come in, Stephen, come in; I'm glad to see you," Gorham greeted him as he puffed into the apartment, almost exhausted by the double strain of losing his self-control and his strenuous efforts to regain it. "I didn't realize it was so warm outside. "Business is business, of course; but you wrote me that you wanted my advice. My time is yours." "You couldn't 'pester' me with them, Stephen. "Yes, yes." he asked. I'll show him. "You've done what?" You've seen him, Robert. I'll show him. "He's my son, isn't he?" "I judge that he has proved that." "He's all I have in the world, Robert. He'll be back." "I'm not so sure," Gorham said, seriously. "So that's what you think of me, is it? "Don't try to juggle with words, Robert. Good-day, I say." "Poor old Stephen," he sighed to himself. "That will be a handsome addition to the dividends already assured the stockholders," Covington observed. "Only a drop in the bucket compared with what is to come," Gorham assured him. "I'm not going to 'throw away' any of it." "As serious as you are." Covington smiled understandingly. "Splendid!" "Your jest is ill timed," Gorham replied, sternly. Covington retreated behind the inexpressive barrier of his superbly controlled features, but the coldness of his eyes showed his resentment. he said, petulantly, to himself. "We are to have our first lesson this morning," he announced. "It is perfectly splendid," Alice cried, her eyes sparkling. "I will explain some of the details to you now," Covington answered, drawing a package of papers from his pocket. the girl demanded, suddenly. Covington was surprised. he asked. "Yes, Allen Sanford. "Yes. Covington smiled, and for some unexplainable reason the girl did not like his smile. Covington asked, watching the girl carefully. "It is always woman's part to give inspiration," assented Covington. You remember what I told your fatherâ"and I meant it. she demanded. They asked me up to dinner, and then I knew it was all off for getting a job. "I'm not sure, but I want to talk it over with you." "What is it, Allen?" cried Alice, expectantly. It's selling books." "Don't mind what I said." Tell us all about it." "Splendid !" cried Alice, clapping her hands. Alice and Mrs. Gorham exchanged glances as Allen busied himself untying a small package he had brought with him. "Here is the brochure, as they call it, and here are the rules of the game. he asked. Great title, isn't it? Are you ready, Mrs. Allen appealed to Mrs. Gorham. "Not yet," she replied. You saw it, didn't you, Alice? Oh, yes, I remember. asked his coach. You are just to sit there entranced while I do this monologue actâ"you're not even expected to ask questions, as any indiscretion such as that is apt to make the agent lose his cue. Alice and Eleanor were convulsed with laughter over Allen's antics, but the boy soon sobered down and again assumed his dignified demeanor. "Oh, sorrow! "There you go asking questions again," protested Allen, "which is strictly forbidden by the rules." "It is 'low tone,' Allen," Mrs. Gorham prompted. Why, of course it wouldâ"and how else can you obtain this ability in so inexpensive, easy, and agreeable a way as by subscribing for a set of the Home Travellers' Volumes?" "But you're not going to take this up, are you, Allen?" "Don't you want me to? Gorham." Alice divined Eleanor's real thought instantly. "Splendid!" she cried. "And what if he doesn't?" Allen asked. Covington returned to New York several days before the Gorhams left Washington. Covington had made his mark before Gorham discovered him. Covington had never from the first sympathized with Gorham's altruistic policies except as a means to an end, nor did he for a moment imagine that Gorham himself had adopted them for any other reason than their intrinsic business value. Covington to-day was, perhaps, as able a business man as Gorham had been when the Consolidated Companies was born, but Gorham in the mean time, by sheer display of extraordinary genius, had become an international figure. Covington would not have been Covington had he not resented this; Covington would not have been Covington had he not succeeded in concealing this resentment from all the world. "That is a matter which is wholly in his hands. "There may be some points that I know more about than Mr. Gorham." Covington nodded acquiescence, though somewhat in the dark as to the object his visitor had in mind. "In the first place," Harris began, adjusting himself in his chair, "let me say that I am a director in the New York Street Railways Company, which is the largest of the present organizations which are eventually to be consolidated into the Manhattan Traction Company. "There is no doubt in anybody's mind that what he says is right; the roads and the stockholders would be distinctly benefitedâ"but how about the directors? "It is a question which Mr. Gorham must answer." You are one of the directors, I understand." "There is enough for every one," assented Harris, with decision; "the only question is how it is to be divided. he asked, more to say something than because of any real interest. It cost him a pretty penny, but he'll double his investmentâ"we can leave him out. "Yes," Harris assented; "but it doesn't end just there. "Wellâ"hardly. "Then why do you give me the information? Gorham." Covington smiled at the assurance Harris displayed. Now I'm going to tell you the rest of it. "There should be no difficulty in fixing that," remarked Covington, sagely, amused by the frank confidence extended to him in spite of his warning. Covington soliloquized. "Exactly," assented Harris. Covington rose from his chair. "Sit down, sit down," Harris insisted. Covington's face preserved its calm expression, though his smile seemed forced. he said. "No, but your stool-pigeon does. Had to do it, you know, to make sure our deal would go through. Covington's face was as impassive as ever when he turned again, looking his companion straight in the eye. "Better thinkâ"" "I shall be very glad to see Mr. Brady with you," was the unexpected answer. "Splendid, Riley!" "It is a fine thing to have our children do us credit. Suppose Jimmie should some day become an alderman! Now tell me what you are thinking over so seriously. "I didn't realize that I became thoughtful so seldom as to have it attract attention; but, since you ask, I am wondering how my business experiment is going to work out." Next to daddy, he's the finest man I know." Covington." "I'd like to ask you a question." Covington." "Oh, no; that is the very thing I mustn't do. "But you can't do anything with that money without your father's permission." "Yes, I can; Mr. Covington has looked it all up. All I have to do is to sign a paper which he will bring me, and he will do the rest." Then aloud, "Did he tell you what the stock was?" "It must be all right, for Mr. Covington knows," the girl insisted; "that's why daddy has him come to teach me. "I will tell you in the morning what I decide." she cried, transferring her caresses to her father. "The boy has some promising stuff in him," was the reply. "Don't you think I could help him by showing him some of the things Mr. Covington has taught me? she pouted. Why, he's only a boy. Why, Allen isâ"just Allen!" "She is growing up too fast, Robert," she concluded. "She's in safe hands," Gorham replied, smiling. Covington gives me glowing accounts of her progress in the little scheme which you so cleverly suggested. "She is a strange girl in some ways," Eleanor replied, "and we must watch her carefully just at this crisis." "We are all inconsistent, aren't we, dear? "You never loved him?" he repeated. "Some time you must tell me about him," Gorham insisted, still reverting to her chance remark. "Some time I will, but not now. Some time, dear, but not now." "Do," Eleanor replied. "I will follow you in a few moments." "There are plenty more right beside you," suggested her father, surprised. Covington was negatively antagonistic from the start in that quiet, skilful way which kept his animosity from any specific expression. "Don't let me disturb you, Missâ"Manager," he said, loftily, as he caught her eye. "What in the worldâ"" she began. he insisted. "I say, are you going to marry him?" "Truly, you don't know how funny you are when you try to be serious. Allen bit his lip. he asked, without looking at her. "Business fiddlesticks!" he interrupted, crossly. "Not to him alone," she answered, demurely. "Don't you think it is better for a girl to make a number of men comparatively happy by being engaged to them than one man supremely miserable by marrying him?" he asked, with despair written on every feature. "Mercy, no! Allen began to be suspicious. she demanded. "Why, Allen Sanford!" "I do," he insisted. "I can't understand you," she said, soberly. "That ought to mean a lot to you, for he is a hard man to satisfy." "No, Allen; you mustn't put it that way. "Oh, don't say that," she begged. "Except for that, I should still be wearing pinafores, and it's as much better for the pater as it is for me to have shed them. "It is for me. "Business is all right, of course," he admitted. "It ought to be. But don't you see what a different proposition it is when a fellow sees a dear girl's face ahead of him in the distance just beyond each obstacle which he has to meet? "But you are playing for high stakes always, Allen; there's success for the winner and failure for the loser." Why, I have done it so long that even if I knew this minute you were going to marry that Covington person, I believe I'd keep right onâ"hoping to get a chance to be your second husband." Allen asked, pertinently. "Hello, Lady Pat!" cried Allen. "Tut, tut." "No, she isn't," Patricia insisted. "Oh, ho!" "I can't marry you because I've made a vow to marry Alice, and it would never do to break a vow, would it?" "Not until she marries some one else," he corrected. he inquired. "And now, fair Lady Pat, good-bye." He called on Brady with Harris, as he promised. "Better than you do, I feel certain." "On the contrary, you will find yourself unable to do this." "You've unloaded, eh? "You need not take any trouble about the matter, as I am quite ready to give you the necessary information. Cheer up. I've tried to find out just what he was up to, but he's smarter in covering his tracks than I am to uncover 'em, even if he ain't quite so smart in some other directions. Covington watched the two men closely. asked Harris. "It is not of great concern to me, and you are perfectly free to communicate it to Mr. Gorham if you choose; but in view of certain things which have occurred since, I should be glad to have the matter dropped if agreeable to you." "Yes," Covington replied; "I am not as avaricious as you are in exacting my pound of flesh. "Then he's been wastin' time," growled Brady, "and he can have all the pink teas he wants with Littleton and Graham. He thinks he's the whole show, he does. He ain't so much." Covington bade them good-morning and returned to his office fairly well satisfied. But he must be more discreet, this he realized. Levy smiled blandly. he replied, conservatively. "There are certain elements which might contain interesting and promising detailsâ"a famous man married to a divorced woman twenty-five years his junior. Yes, there are possibilities. "Assuredly." "There is one other matter," added Levy. Covington looked at him curiously. "There is something in what you say," admitted Levy. Covington was never able to reconcile Gorham's willingness to do business with men of this stamp, and the apparent personal stand which he took against both their practices and their methods. "It is all perfectly consistent," Gorham assured him on more than one occasion. "It is often necessary to walk through filth and slime in order to reach high ground. The transaction, large as it was, proved not a lengthy one. "There ain't anything more, is there?" "Only a little more," Gorham replied, quietly. "What in hell is this a preamble to?" demanded Brady. "Yes, they ought to be satisfied, and I have no doubt they are." "Then what's the point, friendâ"what's all this palaver?" "I didn't overlook them," Gorham replied. "Very good. gasped Brady. "Oh, yes, you will if you sell at all," Gorham rejoined. To-morrow we shall announce the birth of the Manhattan Traction Company, explaining its inception and its intentions. Covington was an interested spectator throughout the conference, and Gorham's supreme command of the situation won from him his silent but profound admiration. But I'll get back at you if it costs me ten years in Sing Sing!" Covington for a second time went directly from Brady's office to his own, but the former complacency was replaced by a vague apprehension. Covington crushed the paper in his hand and turned toward his desk with a changed expression. But he had long since given up all hope that this time would ever come. "Oh, dear; oh, dear!" Buckner boldly placed the cigar between his lips and straightened up. he asked. "Tell me what's up, and perhaps we can make a trade." Buckner laughed at his own joke. "Sure I do, sure I do," Buckner answered, thickly. Buckner whistled suggestively. "It would be a lot of money," he muttered to himself, as he nervously gulped the brandy down, "and it would hit her hard. Go ahead, Levy. Never knew I was so popular, anyhow." Buckner thought hard. "And what is that?" Levy asked, quickly jumping at a possible clew. "I judged so by your letter." Covington was noncommittal. "There will be no difficulty in having the divorce decree granted to Mrs. Bucknerâ"now Mrs. Gorhamâ"set aside whenever you say the word. Covington took the document in his hand and examined it carefully. he asked. "It is a principle of our firm not to discuss methods with our clients. Levy begged. "There is a lot of money in it for both of us." Covington answered him, coldly: "I believe the terms of our business arrangement were clearly understood at the beginning." "Yes, but it is such a nice case," Levy still pleaded. "You need not appear in it at all if you don't want to. "Now, what was it that you found out about Mrs. Gorham's early history?" Covington again held out his hand, taking the second affidavit, which he scrutinized with the same care he gave the first. Levy smiled. "Here is the balance due you. "It is a nice case, such a nice case." Covington was enthusiastic in his reports to Mr. Gorham regarding Alice's proficiency and natural ability along business lines. "That is all right as a pastime, and you shall indulge in it as much as you like, but Mrs. John Covington will have more of a position to live up to even than Miss Alice Gorham." "There need be no haste in your decision," he said, graciously. "Not too long, I hope," he answered, significantly. Covington queried. "Oh, please!" "But you've noticed it, haven't you?" But I had no ideaâ"you quite took my breath away, you are so much older than I am, andâ"" "Am I so terribly old?" "Oh, no; I mean it is I who am so terribly young. Covington watched the girl in amazement as she hastily withdrew her hand and fled from the room. She bent over to kiss her, but the child drew away. asked Alice, taken by surprise. "No; you're so mean to Allen." "Don't be silly, Pat. Why, Allen is only a kid, like you. she interrogated. "Come in, dear," she said; "I am only resting." the girl asked, anxiously, all thought of her errand vanishing; "you were looking very tired at breakfast." "I am so perplexed that I don't know which way to turn. the girl exclaimed, drawing another chair close to Eleanor's, and taking both her hands in her own. "I want to have my life an open book to your father, yet in this one instance I can't see my way clear." "Why, Eleanor!" Alice asked, surprised. "That is the unfortunate part. "No, not even as much as that. Why, of course there isn't." "I wish I had your confidence, dear," Eleanor sighed, "but that would be asking too much." the girl asked, hesitatingly. she cried, hastily. "I will go"; and with slow footsteps she left the room. Its expansion and success were phenomenal, and it was, of a certainty, coming into its own. "Yes, dear, I am dreaming," he said, in answer to her unspoken question. To-morrow she would tell him, but not to-day. Come now, Misther Robert ain't heard about it yit, so it's all right, Jimmieâ"we'll go down-stairs an' have a nice little visit. Gorham." Riley drew back, indecision mingled with a father's pride that a son of his could carry himself with such an air. he repeated. Gorham." he asked, with real concern "â"why do ye wear th' sorry rag on ye'er hat an' th' ravens on ye'er hands?" "It is very good of you to come and tell me this, James," Gorham said, lightly; "but I presume our secret service force already have the gentleman on their list." "You surprise me, James. "He's a blackguard, sir, and a liar. "What is his name?" he asked. One night he says to me, 'I'm goin' to make a lot o' money.' says I, more to be agreeable than because I had any 'special interestâ"'how're you goin' to do it?' "Then he laughed, silly-like, and winked at me. says I, surprised at his line o' talk. "'That's right,' says he. "Yes, James; quite right. You are evidently influenced by your loyalty to my family," Gorham answered. "It is right that you should be, but it shall not be forgotten. "I will, sir," James responded, eagerly. "That is the first thing to discover, James. "Yes, sir; I'll do that, sir. "Me and Mr. Gorham understands each other, that's all." As he did so, he discovered Allen Sanford. "Don't mind me if it gives you any pleasure." Come now, let's drop the subject. "Two lumps, andâ"no lemon, please." he demanded. he almost shouted. If that's your idea of being a man, I'll tell you right now, not for mine." Alice rose, with flaming face. "I told you that you had reached the limit, Allenâ"now you have passed it. I've tried to help you all I could, and this is the result. Now we can't even be friends any more, and this insane jealousy of yours will spoil your chances in the Companies. "Don't worry about me," the boy said, dejectedly. Now I'm in business, and I see the same things there. But don't say we can't be friendsâ"I couldn't stand that. Covington?" "I can't do that," he replied, firmly; "but I'll do my best to let you find him out from some one else." "I'm not ashamedâ"I've simply got to know my future. "But you won't marry Allen, will you?" Pat pleaded, unblushingly. "Between you, I can't get a moment's peace." "Yes." "Brady made him, and now he is collecting his fee. "It can't be dangerous while we have the people so strongly with us, but it might become troublesome. "We are accused of discrimination, Mr. Gorham," the President explained, after the first greetings. "Then we are all ready for the discussion," said the President, touching a button. the Senator asked, quickly. "Exactly." "That is not for me to say." "There can be but one answer to that question," he replied; "it would produce an industrial reign of terror, and yet I am frank to say that, from a legal standpoint, I believe Senator Hunt is correct in his statement that the Government unlawfully discriminates in drawing any distinction between good and bad trusts; but let me say further, that it is my definite opinion that the Sherman Act, as it now stands, is a menace to the country. "Yes," the Attorney-General replied; "our own trust legislation is nothing more than a modern repetition of certain laws which centuries ago were in force in England, and were designed to prevent the formation of co-partnerships in business." "We are digressing," the senator from New York interrupted. "It is a conflict between a literal interpretation of the law and industrial progress," added Senator Kenmore, "and the law as it stands does not appeal to justice nor does it express American public sentiment. "The public," he said, "has long since become accustomed to mergers and consolidations, and has naturally associated with them the strangling of competition and the creation and enjoyment, on the part of a few, of the conditions of monopoly. "Now, I am speaking as a private citizen." "There are human limitations, Mr. Gorham," laughed the Attorney-General. Covington." Come, now, let us forget all this. he burst out suddenly, his voice trembling with emotion. "It is a deep disappointment to me that you feel as you do," he replied. he asked, significantly. "No," Gorham replied, firmly. "In the first place, if he gained control, he would have no desire to change it; in the second, my Executive Committee is made up of men of too high principle to permit him or any other man to operate the Companies upon other than a proper basis." "It is too late to-night to discuss this phase of the subject with you as thoroughly as we must if you are to continue with the corporation, but in the mean time remember that the Consolidated Companies is in the hands of men whose self-interest is coupled with a personal gratification in the altruistic basis whose nature you have learned from me. You are not competent to pass upon their motives, and until you are you should not venture to criticise." You are attempting to interfere in a matter which is too heavy for your strength. "Poor boy, I'm really sorry for him," he said to himself. Covington became a constant visitor at the Gorham home, assuming more and more the prerogatives of an accepted suitor. Covington's first overtures came just at this time and were coldly received; but as Allen considered the matter, he concluded that he would learn to "purr" too, taking lessons in this gentle art from the one man whom he acknowledged to be its past master. she cried, impressively. Now we can have a visit." "Neither did I," he admitted. "There wasn't any money then, like ours, and when they wanted anything they didn't have, they fought for it." "That isâ"one of the principal reasons." "Except Alice," Allen insisted. "I'm afraid so, Lady Pat." Covington?" he demanded, seizing the child almost roughly by the wrist; but Patricia attributed his action to excitement and joy equal to her own, so accepted it cheerfully. "That is it," she repeated, firmly. "I'm sure, for I wrote it down just as soon as I heard it. Good-bye, Lady Patâ"I'll try hard, but don't be disappointed if there aren't any leftâ"good-bye." "It is well to have this come to a head," Gorham remarked after several had expressed their views. "Then let me ask a few questions," continued Gorham. "I cannot agree with you," Gorham said, firmly. But all this was a means to an end. "John." "But you won out," Covington exclaimed, amazed that Gorham seemed not to have comprehended his words. Oh, the pity of it! Covington found himself being rapidly forced into an equivocal position. "Compromise?" repeated Gorham, questioningly. "There can be no conciliation, Covington," was the firm response; "there can be no compromise. "That is a large contract for any one man to undertake," Covington remarked. "We are talking of unusual things," Gorham replied. "Absolutely." he again asked. "There must be some purpose behind it all." "There is. "Do I, then, stand alone?" Covington resented the suggestion. "There should be no question in your mind as to where I stand," he said. Suppose you do a little thinking, too, along my line. Covington was a skilful tactician, and in the present crisis the affidavits he had stored away in his safe-deposit drawer tempted him sorely. Covington returned the affidavit to him and left him free to proceed or not, as he saw fit. Buckner was quickly summoned to the lawyer's office and a new agreement drawn between them, which gave special joy to Buckner, as it meant an increased supply of money and a renewed lease of life in New York City, which he had learned to "love." "Why, Eleanor!" "There can be nothing to thisâ"can there?" "There will be no need," Gorham replied, with a lightness he did not feel; "I will find this man and will settle it for all time." "It must," was Gorham's decisive answer. "It can't." "It can't, Robert; you know it can't, dear. We must know the facts now, dear." Don't be quixotic and play into the hands of these scoundrels who have gotten hold of Buckner, and are trying to reach me through you, knowing well that this is my vulnerable point." "It is unnecessary, Eleanorâ"it is unwise. he repeated. he asked, brokenly. "A trial, Robert?" she cried. "Why not?" he asked. "It would kill me," she replied, not meeting his look. he asked, quietly. "Don't you know enough already to understand why I could never live through it?" "There must be no trial," he said, firmly. You must leave it all in my hands." "You'll have a hard fight on your hands, Mr. Gorham. "That will be as long as we remain associated in the corporation," Gorham said, with conviction. "I wish you would advise me, Mr. Covington." "You see, I don't quite know where I stand just now. Covington did not doubt the sincerity which Allen's words and tone apparently expressed. "There is only one possible outcome," he replied, frankly. "But you don't think he will, do you?" "No, but those ideals are pretty well developed." Covington looked at him critically. I am with him, of course, but the clerks have no special obligation to any one. But personally, I'm not expecting any break." Covington laughed at the boy's simplicity. His ideals didn't trouble him any then, yet he succeeded. Covington's conversation with Allen was as frank and cordial as the boy could have asked, yet between the two there was a barrier beyond which Allen could not venture to pass. Covington had not retreated from his position that a compromise of some sort was desirable, but he succeeded in convincing Gorham that this was simply a difference in viewpoint, and that his chief's judgment would, of course, be final. Covington congratulated himself upon the happy solution of the most dangerous horn of his dilemma. "'Tis of a confidential nature," he replied, loftily. "Himâ"and others." 'Tis confidential, I tell you." Shure ye'll tell me about it, Jimmie, shure ye will." "That isâ"provided she is his wife. Now, do you understand where I come in?" Gorham." "He's got what he's paid for," James asserted. "Sure." "Business is business," James replied, sagely. Riley demanded, sternly. "Ah, ha! "Liar," James replied, sententiously. "Right ye are, Jimmie! Liar it is, tho' 'twud serve him right ter be th' other. "Ah, ha!" Ah, let him worry; it's good f'r him. Buckner likes me." he inquired, quietly. "Oh, no, sirâ"I'm feeling very well, I thank you, sir," James answered in a quick, frightened voice. "Yes, James," Gorham agreed. Now tell me what is the important information which your father promised me you would bring with you ?" "Not a word, James. "You see, sir," James began, "there's another Mrs. Buckner." Now tell me all you know about it." "I cannot delay a moment," Gorham at length declared. "I cannot, I cannot," she cried at last, all the pent-up feeling of the last few moments finding expression in these brief words. "I cannot tell him." Alice asked, a shade of reproach showing in her voice. "It ought not to be so hard now, dear. But, of course, you are right. asked Gorham. "We are working hard, Gorham," the Senator replied. "That was a great move of yours, having each stockholder invest in the Consolidated Companies to such an extent that it made the welfare of the corporation a matter of personal concern. "We are fighting all right, and the result is bound to be the same whether it is for the people or for ourselves. "How sober you are to-night, Allen," she said. "Forgive me for being such poor company," he replied, simply. "What is it, then?" asked Alice. he said. "Why not now, Allen?" Alice asked, curious to know what so affected him. "I want to hear them, Allen," she insisted; "I have a right to hear them." "She is right," he added. "Now, out with it, boy, and let us get to the bottom of things." Why, I haven't even brains enough to comprehend. Good-night andâ"good-bye." "For the first time in my life, I tell you, you are wrong." "Be patient, Robert," begged Eleanor. "I do mean it, Allen. But I'll never forget it, Alice, never. Don't blame her, Mr. Gorham. Good-bye." "Compromise, I hope," Covington replied. "I can't imagine, unless through some one of the secret-service men." "Certainly not." Covington resented the suggestion. "It is a complete mystery to me. Covington's watchful mind noted the evasion. "There is no question in the minds of any of us that the services of our president are still absolutely essential to the success of the corporation, and we have no wish or intention of having him separate himself from it; but we have become aware, through the unprecedented position which has been taken, that if those interests which we represent are to be safeguarded, immediate action must be taken to convince him that the Consolidated Companies is not his personal property, that the Executive Committee are not mere puppets, and that even the president of a great and successful corporation is, after all, an employee of that corporation, and subject to its control. "All that remains, then, is for you gentlemen to give me your assurances upon one point: namely, that the present basis of profit-sharing with the public shall not be disturbed. "I told you, gentlemen, that I had awakened from my Utopian dream. "Most assuredly." Covington watched his chief critically as the blow began to fall. "There is no one present who does not regret the lack of friendliness which prevented our president from giving him an equal chance with himself in the purchase of stock in the New York Street Railways Company." "Come, Gorham, admit that the joke's on you," Litchfield laughed. "A young lady down-stairs to see you, sir." demanded Allen. "She wouldn't give her name, sir." "I'm not alone," she insisted. Come, let's go and find Riley." "Ah, there ye are, praise be ter th' Virgin Mary," he panted. I cudn't hilp it, Misther Allen, I cudn't nohow," heading off any criticism from that quarterâ""she wud have it, and that's th' ind iv it. I cudn't hilp it, nohow." Shall I fold 'em up an' put 'em in th' thrunks fer ye, sor?" "Here are my things, too, Riley." he demanded. "In the first place, I have made your father very angry with me." "I certainly do," Allen said, truthfully. "Gee, but I wish Mr. Covington would hurry up!" Alice's attitude was that of sympathy and pity, but little Pat saw in him, the failure, those attributes which belong to the Knight Courageous, undaunted by the hostile flings of Fortune. Come to me first, and let me tell you the whole story." Covington was surprised that the blow did not fall upon him immediately after the meeting of the committee adjourned. Covington seemed not to recognize him, but Brady's face assumed a significant and satisfied expression. Covington seated himself in silence. It wasn't necessary to say why." "But you don't really believe that this stock was purchased for me, or with my knowledge, do you?" "Then why did you say what you did? "That was just why I did do it," he said. You licked me, an' I took my medicine. I'm a sport all right, an' I know when to take my hat off to any man. "Wellâ"go on." He see the game was up, of course, an' then he tried to be smart. Well, you remember what happened. he asked, in a voice which betrayed the feeling beneath by its quiet restraint. Covington asked. "What is to be gained by that?" "Certainly," Gorham replied, wonderingly. "I will see you at nine o'clock." But don't tell him this. "I told you he'd make a fine business man," Stephen could not resist saying. "I do," laughed Gorham. "That is why I gave him the chance. You remember asking me to do it, don't you?" Good-night, Stephen. Covington entered the library, walking with short, quick steps quite unlike his usual deliberate gait, and sat down in the chair just vacated by Mr. Sanford. As far as I am concerned, you may have no anxiety. "I told you I was desperate, and so I am. "All that may have been true, Covington, in the past. Covington hesitated even then. asked Gorham. "What is the nature of them this time?" But I have chosen. "Ask Mrs. Gorham and Miss Alice to come here, Riley." Covington cried. "What is it, Eleanor,â"let me read it with you. Shall I, daddy?" Alice demanded. "Yes, beyond anything and everything else." "Yes." Covington gained confidence from the ease with which all was moving. "It is sometimes necessary to walk through filth and slime to attain high places," he remembered Gorham had once told him. "Yes," was the firm reply. "I understand it, Eleanor," Gorham replied. "No," Gorham answered, shortly; "it is the same story with a different interpretation." "I do believe you, Eleanor," Gorham replied. "And what is more, I know that you speak the truth." "The public may not be so generous," suggested Covington. he asked. "I am sure I should," she replied, wonderingly. Covington made no answer to the impelling voice which spoke. Covington stood in the doorway of the library as Alice slipped quietly into the room and took her place beside Eleanor and her father. "It is all over, Mr. Gorham," he forced himself to say. "It is not you who have defeated me, it is I who have defeated myself. You are a young man. Covington bowed his head, and without a word disappeared. I loved her then, but she was another man's wife. "I wanted your love, dear heart, not your gratitude." he demanded. "Yes, sir; eighth floor. "You needn't say any name,â"I'll say it myself. "I'm not a football dummy. "You've come just in time. You said I'd come back, and you were right. "You've run in debt, have you?" "Not yet. "I ought not to have done it," the boy admitted. Allen asked, disappointed that their visit was to be interrupted. "At Gorham's." "No; he wants to talk with you, especially." "Then we'll dine with him, as he asks us to. Now lead on to that calf, but make it a little one." But he could not blame them. "But you can't do it," Sanford declared. "No," Gorham replied, firmly. "And now for the most humiliating confession of all: I myself have been guilty of an exercise of my own self-interest as flagrant as any of my associates, though in a different way. "Yes, and more. So be it. "And now, Stephen, as to this boy. Covington." Alice's cheeks were flaming, but her smile was irresistible as she spoke. "I'll tell you all about it, Allen, if you'll come into the conservatory." "Yes," replied Gorham, resolutely; "I realize it all. she cried, joyfully, after reading the telegram. "There never has been," he replied, as he pressed her to him. He sat beside her, and wrapped his great arms around her. "Don't cry, Lady Pat," he entreated. "I can't help it," she moaned. "Oh, no, no!" he begged. "No, daddy," she replied, slyly.
