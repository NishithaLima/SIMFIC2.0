 Thou vain dreamer, this hour is her last!" Each Book is in One Volume, Morocco Cloth, price $1.75. A DOUBLE WEDDING; or, How She Was Won. From Gail Hamilton, author of "Gala Days" etc. This is no common occurrence with a veteran romance reader like myself." thou vain dreamer, this hour is her last!" WILSON, "Isle of Palms." "No, subtle snake! It is the baseness of thy selfish mind, Full of all guile, and cunning, and deceit, That severs us so far, and shall do ever." JOANNA BAILLIE, Tragedy of "Orra." "That is a grand thoughtâ"one that I saw lately in a Western poem, the New-Year's address of a young editor of Kentucky called Prentice. Is it not splendid, Marion?" "Very awful, rather," she responded, with a faint shudder. I stand reproved, my child. All honor to Time, the merciful, whether he builds palaces or tombs! "Oh, but he is not; he is a good Whig insteadâ"a Clay man, as we call such." It is very natural, for you, Miss Harz," in a somewhat deprecating tone, "to praise your partisans. "Oh, no, Major Favraud; you must excuse me, indeed! And I wanted to tell you, while I could speak of her, how much my poor wife liked you. The time will come when I must not, dare not, you know. I need not feign any longer, nor apologize either." "It must have been that she saw how lovely and spirituelle I found her," I said, "and could not bear to be outdone in consideration, nor to owe a debt of social gratitude. "I know one man, at least, who never foments discord in this way! He is a Yankee, of course! Now, do you earnestly believe a native of New England, by descent a legitimate witch-burner, you know, can be any thing better than a poll-parrot in the poetical line?" "Have we not proof to the contrary, Major Favraud?" But when it comes to grating the nut for negus, we miss the aroma!" It is sheer slander, that you have caught up from some malignant British review, and, like all other serpents, you are venomous in proportion to your blindness! "You are content with mere externs in finding your similitudes, Major Favraud! No Cavalier blood there, I fancy! Byron was a poet in spite of his condition, not because of it. Yet these were men of medium condition, allâ"I hate the conceits of Cowley, Waller, Sir John Suckling, Carew, and the like. "All this is overwhelming, I grant," bowing deferentially. Then men's souls shall have been tried in the furnace of affliction, and Greek meets not Greek, but Yankee. I asked. "Now, that is poetry, Miss Harz! I assented mutely, scarce knowing why I did so. "Now, hear another." And the woods rang with his clear, sonorous accents as he declaimed, a little too scanningly, perhapsâ"too much like an enthusiastic boy: "Love lurks upon my lady's lip, His bow is figured there; Within her eyes his arrows sleep; His fetters areâ"her hair!" Is it not, indeed, all couleur de rose? "You are right: our 'Shortfellow' was incapable of any thing of the sort. With all his nerve and vim, he died of melancholy, I believe. As good an end as any, however, and certainly highly respectable. I did not reflect sufficiently perhaps, on his ignorance of many of these last. a little embarrassed, I perceived, by my manner. "I will take the chance of that," laughing. "Come, the poem, if you care to please your driver, and reward his care. proceed, I entreat you! it is very beautifulâ"very touching, too!" "As you please, then;" and I continued the recitation. the chords are mute, The bond is rent in twain; You cannot wake the silent lute, Or clasp its links again. "What, indeed?" he exclaimed, impetuouslyâ"tears now streaming over his olive cheeks. You feel for me, you do not deride me! the chords are mute, The bond is rent in twain.'" "I shall never marry againâ"never! "Oh, but you will not always feel so; there may come a time of reaction." "No, never! he interrupted, passionately; "don't even suggest itâ"don't! Mocking fiends, usually, the best of them! The bubble of life has burst, and my existence falls flat to the earth. "Let him make a name, then," I urged. Something of an epicurean, too, in his high estate. as John Gilpin said, or some one of himâ"which was it?" "And strangely on the knight looked he, And his blue eyes gleamed wild and wide." "Tremble, France! It is impressive, after all." "Both in one, it seems to me," was the reply. I ought to have told you, before we came, not to be surprised." "No, I have no idea who it is, or who are his companions either," she replied; "unless"â"hesitating with scrutiny in her eyesâ" "His companions, I do not care to question of them!â"but that man himselfâ"the speakerâ"has a sovereign presence! best of friends, welcome back to Georgia!" And tears started to his eyes and choked his utterance. For, with his friends, he was then en route for another appointment. He was canvassing the State, with a view to a final rally of its resources, preparatory to his last great effortâ"to scotch the serpent of the North, which finally, however, wound its insidious folds around the heart of brotherly affection, stifling it, as the snakes of fable were sent to do the baby Hercules. I asked. "Oh, yes; Scottish songs and classic verse, especially, are his delights. "Only the sauces, Favraud!â"seulement les sauces." "You are too unsteady, Favraud, for my maÃ®tre d'hÃ´tel. "Are you a fairy, madame?" "Much more like a witch," she said, with gayety. "Ah! "Puns, madame, puns, not pills. It is time you were beginning to master our language. She bowed in answer, well pleased. "I make no confections," she said, "but I have lived on the juices of good meats, well prepared, with such vegetables as the Lord lets grow in this poor region, many years, and behold I am old and still able to do his service!" added Major Favraud, impertinently. "When attainable, Favraud. "You are going to hear her talk now," whispered Favraud; "that is a signâ"equal to General Finistere'sâ"the snuffbox tapping, I mean. and he inclined his head before her. I am a great sinner, Miss Harz thinks." She, too, is Catholic, I hope. "Ah, madame, that was cruel! "Come, Favraud, explain. I continued. "As for me, I am simply a governess." "I do not agree with you, mademoiselle. And she applied herself again assiduously to her snuffbox, tapping it peremptorily before opening it, and, with a gloomy eye fixed on space, she continued: "In all lands, from the time of Cassandra and Jeremiah up, there have been prophets. "Where do you leave Mr. Webster, John Quincy Adams, General Jackson himself, in such a category, madame?" I asked, eagerly. "She is equal to Madame Le Normand!" "If one waits long enough, most prophecies may be fulfilled," I ventured; "but, madame, your words point to results too terribleâ"too unnatural, it seems to me, ever to be realized in these enlightened times or in this land of moderation." "Child," she responded, "blood asserts itself to the end of races. "But you forget, madame, that Mr. Clay is a Western man, a Virginian, a Kentuckian, and the representative of slave-holders," I remonstrated. "All this is true," she answered, "in one sense. It is thus he speaks, and, like all partial parents, even thinks he feels toward his offspring; but observe his acts narrowly from first to last. He loves machineryâ"the sound of the mill, the anvil, the spinning-jenny, the sight of the ship upon the high-seas, or steamboat on the river, the roar of commerce, far more than the work of the husbandman. You yourself will say amen to that, I am convinced." she murmured. "What is a conservative, after all, but a social parrot, who repeats 'wise saws and modern instances,' until he believes himself possessed of the wisdom of all the ages, and is incapable of conceiving of the existence even of an original idea?" "Yes, hear him, and he edified," was the sarcastic response of Favraud to Duganne, who took no other notice, even if he understood the point, than to lead the way to the portico, where swung the cage of the jolly bird in question; and, headed by Madame Grambeau leaning on her cane, we followed simultaneously, with the exception of Major Favraud, who continued at the table with his cigar and cognac-flask, in sullen and solitary state. shrieked the parrot, as we stood before him. "Ha, ha, ha!" "That is condensing the matter, certainly," I observed. "Bienvenu, compatriote!" he repeated many times, laughing loudly, the next moment, as if in mockery. "What a fiend it is!" "Danton! "Bird of freedom, moultingâ"moulting!" give us your paw, Old Hickâ"Hickâ"Hickory!" "Approach, Favraud, and justify yourself. He is as bad as the 'Vert-vert' of Voltaire. "Danton, how can you so grieve your mistress?" remonstrated Major Favraud, lifting at the same time an admonitory finger, at which recognized signal, a part of past instructions probably, the parrot burst forth at once in a series of the most grotesque and outrÃ© oaths ear ever heard, ending by the aid of some prompting from his teacher by dismally croaking the fragment of a popular song thus travestied: "My ole mistis dead and gone, She lef to me her ole jawbone. "Many parrots have I seen, but never one like this before. "I can teach any thing to every thing," digressed Major Favraud, "and without severity; it is my specialty. he asked, calmly. Life is uncertain, and, young and strong as you are, or seem to be, you cannot foresee one hour even of the future, or of your own existence. "So many conflicting directions confuse and mystify me, I confess. "But your receiptâ"you have forgotten to take it up!" "My dear young lady," he remonstrated, "I am shocked. "I do not know, I am sure, why I should be so weak for such a trifle," I said, after a few swallows of ice-water had somewhat restored my equilibrium; "but I do feel very dismally about this voyageâ"have done so ever since I left Beauseincourt. This is the last straw on the camel's back, believe me, General Curzon. "What is the use of bewailing the inevitable?" he pursued. Beauseincourt, and all its shadows, had I not put behind me? Truly my bosom's lord sat lightly on her throne, as of late it had not been her wont to do. I was in my own element again, and my powers were all responsive. "We shall get up the band to-morrow evening," said Major Ravenel, "and have a dance; the gallop would go grandly here. "But all that could be done on shore as well, Miss Pyne," I replied, in the way of reminiscence. Thetis is very spiteful, sometimes; and jealous, too, you remember." He was a Jerseyman, he told us, of German descent, married to the girl of his heart, and living on the coast of that adventurous little State, famous alike for its peaches and wrecks. and he indicated it with the pipe he held in one sinewy handâ"for the native courtesy of the man had involuntarily proffered us the homage of removing it from his lips, when we addressed him. Do explain, Mr. Garth," said Miss Lamarque. And so speaking, he turned his wheel in silence warily. "But you have the command of the helm, and have nothing to do butâ"" "Obey orders," he interrupted, grimly. "Ef the captain was to tell me to run the ship to purgatory, I'd have to do it, you know." remonstrated Miss Lamarque, indignantly. Graze itâ"Heaven, what rashness!" Wouldn't you like one for a pet, Miss Harz?" He laughed. "Come, Miss Lamarque," I interrupted. "I must not hear another word. "Yes, all alike," I repeated, making, as I spoke, one mental entire reservation. "No, no, carry out your first intention and conciliate him; for, remember, he has us in the hollow of his hand. "Oh, vastly! Don't cultivate it, dear, if you hope to win manly hearts. Give a pair of tongs pantaloons, and it asserts itself. Trousers, my dear, are at the root of manly presumption. This is my theory, at least; take it for what it is worth. "He has called you the most agreeable woman in Savannah, I remember, young or old, and was truly glad, on my account, to know that you were on board. Of your brother he spoke very kindly also, even admiringly." "Oh, yea, I know; but of Raguet there is little question now. "I will keep it there," he said, "young miss," pressing it closely against his side with his colossal hand, "until I get safe home to the Jarseys, and to Sall, or go to Davy's locker, one or other, but which it will be, young galâ"young miss, I should be sayingâ"is not for me to know." "Nor for anyone," I rejoined, solemnly; "all rests with God." Truly, ours seems to be doing giant's work; now we are flying, to be sure." Do you really apprehend danger for us now?" I asked, after studying his countenance for a moment, "or, are you again desirous to try the nerves of your female passengers? No, you are quizzing me again, and very cruelly this time, very unwarrantably." I asked, after a pause, during which his pitying eye rested on me drearily. "You are better now," she said, kindly; "the man at the wheel called me as I was passing, and pointed out your condition, and I led you here, and ran for water. "What are these people crawling about the deck for? Is all hope over, or was it only a dream?" I asked. His melancholy air, and the preoccupation of his manner, confirmed my worst fears. "Has the captain no hope of rescue, Mr. "Oh, yes; he thinks we shall meet a ship or two between now and noonâ"we 'most always do, you know"â"rolling his quid slowly, and hesitating for a while; "keep heart, keep heart! He means to do what's right, never fear. It is my dooty to hold you here until he comes, onless you promise me to be discreet." "I shall be discreet, never fearâ"" and his grasp relaxed. "Is your little boy ill, madam?" I asked at last; and at the sound of my voice a smile broke over his small, sallow features, lending them strange beauty, but dying away instantly again into an expression of startled suspicion. "Yes, very ill," she answered, clasping him tenderly as he clung to her suddenly. "He has some settled trouble that no medicine reaches, and you see how small and light he is. She overrated my benevolence on this occasion, however. What nonsense these wiseacres talk, to be sure! "But you are very pale to-day, my childâ"what on earth can be the matter?â"There, Dominica, I thought I heard Florry cry! It may be some time before they get their regular morning meal.â"They have to wait, you know, Miss Harz, which is such rank injustice where children are concerned. Now, you see, I have my lecturing-cap on, and am almost equal to you or Dr. Lardner in my way. and do you hesitate, on account of Miss Moore? "Currer Bell is not more mysteriously awful, but Garth is not artistic. the iceberg is gone, I know. Why, what a nervous coward you are, to be sure, with all that assumed bravery! why, of course, and a third, if you want it; I am delighted you like it. No. Well, I can't imagine any thing worse, to save my life. "But, Captain Ambroseâ"he did not tell you so?" "We shall see, but for the present say nothing; only get up and dress as quickly as you can, but it is important to be very quiet, for fear of causing confusion. "I can do nothing for myselfâ"nothingâ"I am so weak, so helpless. She will be nerveless if she knows the truth, and you are not in a condition to conceal it." "Just as you will, then. You may bring me a slice of bread, if you choose, when you come back, and one for baby. "You are a strange woman, Miriam Harz! At such an hour as this, what matters the quality of food?" said Miss Lamarque, sententiously. "After all, what can that invalid and her child be to you in any case? This is the last meal any one will take on the ship Kosciuskoâ"she is doomed! "Oh, no! not with that low, terrible roaring in the hold. "Don't be down-hearted, young gal, an' wait for me. "There are little children," I said; "six of them belonging to that lady and Mr. Lamarque. "I came up as soon as I could, to relieve you. "Did you leave the other passengers at table?" I asked; "the captain, was he there?" This was no immigrant-ship, loaded with stolid or desperate men, insensible of high teachings, and alone desirous of personal safety. Yet the universal instinct asserted itself, and for the time courtesies were set aside, and family affections were all that were regarded. It is true that Miss Lamarque, by many signs, implored me to come to her, but I would not. This task is not for me, although the holiest. O cruel, cruel fiends! And she clasped her hands in mute and bitter despairâ"no actress was ever so impressive. "Then, if God sees fit to deliver us, we shall be all the more thankful. Now, don't be frightened; speak calmly." "He gives us self-respect, and commands us to cherish it. It is very bitter to die, as young as we are; but, if we have done our best to serve Him, we needâ"we ought not to be afraid to meet our God." The feeble widow with her child, too, crept close to me, weeping and trembling. I did not leave Savannah under Miss Lamarque's care. It is the duty of Captain Ambrose to see to the welfare of his female passengers. He was calm, collected, serious, but not afraid. "Not intended, then," I said, eagerly. "Oh, I am glad of this, at least, for the honor of human nature." and Dunmore rushed with the rest to descry its myth-like form, if possible. "Farewell, sweet, young, vigorous life!" "Farewell, Miriam! "Sister, lover, farewell! Mother, father, receive me! Saviour, my soul is thine!" So help ye, mighty God!" The man himself, to whom we owed our deliverance, stood near his primitive mast, trimming his sail carefully, and looking out with his far-reaching, sagacious ken over the waste of waters, into which the blood-red, full-orbed sun seemed dipping, suddenly, as for his night-bath. I asked of the young girl as I put back my hair that had clustered thickly over my face in my uneasy slumber, and followed eagerly the direction of her eyes. I answered, sorrowfully, for the levity of her spirit grieved and shocked me. "Water, water!" Dar, now! And she pointed to a large white gull, skimming the main at some distance. Then burst the storm upon usâ"rain, wind! Her name is Greene, so they call her Du Vert, to make out that she is Frenchâ"vert is green, in French, you see; or so they tell me. Who are you, to prevent me? If He don't care, who need care?â"An't I right, old mammy?" "He cannot come to me here," I thought. Oh, the sweet olive-branch! How long this slumber lasted, or whether it came at all, I never knew. "You are awake and yourself again, young lady, I am glad to see! "Yes, very weak; but not hungry at all. It is such enjoyment." "All safe, I believe, and on board, well cared for, like yourself. This was what the captain called it," and she smiled. "Yes, he is at last out of danger, and we have obtained a nurse for him. "Yes, he was my principal care on the raft, and I do not wish to lose sight of him. "Oh, certainly!" "Yes, I am strangely weakâ"confused, even," and I passed my hand over my blistered face and dishevelled hair with something of the feeling of the little woman in the story who doubted her own identity. "I cannot; it nauseates me but to see it, to think of it. "Oh, no; that is impossible. Come, now, be reasonable. This is very nice, seasoned with madeira and nutmeg." "Ah! I most have lapsed again into reverie rather than slumber, from which I was partly aroused by whispering voices at the door, one of which seemed familiar to me. 'â"Eh, Clayton?" with a sneering simper; "and what eyes, what teeth, to be sure! "And you shall stand bridesmaid, my dear. "Oh, not at all!" "Miriam for the present, if you please. This is no time nor place for ceremony." "Well, Miriam it shall be," she repeated with laughing eyes hers were of that sort which close and grow Chinese under the pressure of merriment and high cheekbones combined . "Miriam, I like the nameâ"there is something grand about it." "But how shall we know where to find your friends when we get to port?" "Be patient with me," I entreated. I asked, feebly; "can it be possibleâ"" and I wrung my hands. "I do not believe you have an acquaintance on the ship," she said, simply, "Under the circumstances any such person would certainly have discovered himself; your situation would have moved a heart of stone." "But it is sometimes wise for the wicked to lie perdu," I murmured, and conjecture was busy in my brain. "Oh, certainly; but I am afraid he cannot come to-night. It is very necessary you should gather strength, for we shall be in port shortly, when all will be confusion." "And in your state-room, captain!" "Oh, not at all, not at all; when he has a snug nest on land, with a wife and children waiting to receive him. "I'll send you my passenger-list if you choose, and you can read it over keerfully. I asked, desperately. It seemed to nerve him strangely. For yourself, I shall seek another opportunity." he interrupted. "Keep your watch, young lady. You don't keer nothing about seeing of it, do you, now?" and he crumpled it in his hand. "It may be," I added, "that, on reaching the port of New York, a friend or friends who expected me on the Kosciusko may be in waiting to receive me; that is, if the fate of that vessel be not already known. At all events, I was reassured on one subjectâ"those honest eyes, that frank if ugly mouth had no acquaintance with lies, or the father of them, I saw at once; and the voice of the ship's doctor had for the nonce deceived my practised ear, overstrung by suspicionâ"enfeebled by suffering. He is a good soul, and has shown you great interest. "I shall go to the Astor House," I faltered. "No, I prefer to see Christian Garth before I try to sleepâ"the man who steered our raftâ"and the young girl he saved, and the babyâ"let them all come to me, and we will go on shore together." "Oh, she has strength for any thing!" "No doubt of that.â"But, dear Miss Miriam, do speak to me. "Well, Clayton, then, now and forever." rouse up, little one! Nice fellows, are they not?" "What are you waiting for, Captain Van Dorne?" The other, firmly closed, seemed to be the outlet of the chamberâ"its only oneâ"with the exception of the four large Venetian windows, two on either side of me as I lay, the sashes of which, warm as the season was, were drawn closely down. "All this must end to-day," I said, "when really clothed and in my right mind." "Who have called, Mrs. Clayton! "Oh, there were no cards, and such as want to see you can come again. Who sent these flowers, by-the-by, Mrs. Clayton? "Be good enough to do it for me, Mrs. Clayton, or cause it to be done immediately." "I cannot transcend my orders by doing any thing of the kind," she said quietly, yet resolutely, as she pursued her avocation, that of dusting with a bunch of colored plumes the delicate ornaments of the Ã©tagÃ¨re carefully one by one. I asked indignantly. "I will go instantly." It is locked without, and there is no other outlet." I said, grasping her feebly yet fiercely, by the arm. "I know your condition, and pity and respect it, but I shall certainly fulfill my part of this undertaking. "Where am I, then!" "I will give them no advantage," I considered. I asked, after a pause, during which she had not ceased to dust the furniture and arrange the bed in its pristine order, speckless, with lace-trimmings, pillow-cases smooth as glass, and sheets of lawn, and counterpane of snow. "When he returns I will make known your wish to him, if, indeed, he does not call of his own accord." I asked again, after another dreary pause. "I know nothing more than I have told you," she replied. The doctor has decided that this is best." "And whence did he derive his authority?" I did not alight with him when he left the carriage to make these inquiries, but I perfectly remembered the old gray stone building, with its ancient elms, and the impression of gloom and awe it had left on my mind. "Well, den, dat young gal gone to 'tend on Mrs. Raymond, and, as fur de chile, dey pays me to take kear of dat in dis very house ware you is disposed of. Try, Sabra, for humanity's sake." continued Mrs. Clayton, throwing off her mask. Do you understand me?" "Yes, very natural. Selfishly, as well as charitably, would I cherish him. "Lunatics are rarely governed by motives at all," I replied, "only impulses. "Command me in any way dat accords wid my duty," he continued, "yes! "Oh, not for vorlds!" "You are very kind; I believe, though, that is all we have to say to one another, Dr. "You are bettair, then?" "Not now, at least, Dr. "Permit me, then, to feel your pulse vonce more. The man was an impostor, a tool, as criminal as his employerâ"not the footprint on the sand was more suggestive to Robinson Crusoe than that luminous streak to me, nor the cause of wilder conjecture. "Lady got cake in pocket, give Ernie some?" Hypochondria, baby as he was, seemed already to have fixed his fangs upon him. , and love and respect are not to be compelled. It is the error of all errors to suppose that, because a child has a sickly frame or imperfect animal organization, it is just or profitable to give it over to its own devices, and consign it to indolence and ignorance. Feed well the hungry mind, lest it perish of inanition. "A few leetle pills, then, for both mother and child;" he suggested, humbly. "You are mistaken if you imagine any relationship to exist between Ernie and myself," I answered, calmly, never dreaming at the moment of covert or intended insult. "I shall remembair vat you say," he observed, "and try to do bettair next visit; but all dis time I delay in de execution of my mission here. I need not mention her name, if you are wise. Had Wentworth spoken, then? No, noâ"a thousand times, no! He was not the man with whom to make such conditionsâ"the man I lovedâ"nay worshiped almost. He was of the old heroic mould, that would have preferred any certainty to suspense, and death itself to an instant's degradation. asked the Mercury of my Jove, clasping his costumed hands together, then dropping them meekly before him. Dere is pen, and ink, and papair, I perceive, on dat table. I said, quickly, glancing at him with a derisive scorn that did not escape his observation. "Disgrace, rather," I substituted. "But you have your own stand-point of view, of course. The shield that to you is white, to me is black as Erebus. "And who, let me ask, is this Paladin of chivalry?" I inquired, derisively. he exclaimed, ferociously, "for trouble missy. I most go and comfort her and soothe her pains, as Dinah cannot do. Ernie, on the contrary, grappled with obstacles uncomplainingly, and was only outspoken in his moments of gratification. It may be supposed, then, that when, on the morning after Dr. Englehart's visit, before my chamber had been swept and garnished, and while Mrs. Clayton was busy in her own, Ernie brought me a letter and laid it on the table before me, as Dr. Englehart had done the night before in his presence, I was infinitely amused. Keep them in ignorance of each other, and all will yet go well. "There have been strange reserves between us that never ought to have existed, on my part as well as yours. These particulars I gathered from strangers, but there were many wanting which you can best supply. That this child survived I have painful cause to remember. I did not stop to think what impression my inquiries would leave upon his mind, ever prone to levity and suspicion; but he must have seen that I was deeply moved, and that no impertinent curiosity could sway me to such a course with regard to the woman I loved and had openly declared my plighted wife. At all events, let me know the truth, and look it in the face as soon as may be. To this, as yet, he held no clew. "What if they remove him?" "Ah! what, indeed!" "You are perfectly infatuated, Miss Monfort; I declare, I shall begin to believeâ"" "No, you shall not begin to believe any such thing," I interrupted her, smiling; "you are surely too sensible and just a woman to begin to believe fallacies thus late in the day." "Have it your own way," she said, sharply; "you always get the better of me at last." "Not always," I pursued, "or I should not be here, you know. you have my life-secret," she said, with a desperate gesture; "use it as you will." "What is more," she said, huskily, "I, too, am watched; I never knew this until two days ago: a negro man, an attendant of the house, an old servant of your guardian's, I believe, guards the doors below, and refuses to let me pass to and fro. Dinah, even, is employed to dog my steps. This is not exactly what I bargained for; yet, in spite of all, on her account I shall be faithful to the end." Why should I hate you, Mrs. Clayton? And the women are dressed in paste jewelry, like that our cook-maid wears to parties, and no jeweler would give a cent for them; and the fairies are poor girls, dressed up for the occasion; and the whole play is made up as they go. And then, those fairy, Sabbath chimes! This was no idle dream, no mirage of a vagrant brain like that sea-picture, or that wild vision at Beauseincourt, but sober, and sad, and strange reality. The rattling of china and silver might be discerned in the ancient dining-room, at morn and night. In other words, Christianity has conquered Judaism. "No, Miss Monfort, it is simply impossible. Why, what possesses you to-day, Miss Miriam?" "I shall answer no questions, Mrs. Claytonâ"this right, at least, I reserveâ"but, the fact is, I doubt every thing lately, except this child and God. And tears rolled down my face, the first I had shed for days. "I cannot be mistaken," I interrupted, with impetuosity, "I have heard his step; he eats in the room below; I am convinced, for I know of old that bronchial cough of hisâ"the effect of gormandismâ"" Then suddenly, Ernie, looking up, made a revelation, irrelevant, yet to my ear terrible and astounding, but fortunately incomprehensible to my companion. "No, I will make the tea, Ernie, as long as we stay together. Oh, fortunate misunderstanding! He was quite a picture as he came inâ"a fashion-plate, and as such I coolly regarded himâ"fresh, fair, and smiling, looking younger, if possible, than when we parted a year before, and handsome, as that much-abused word goes, in his debonair, off-hand style of appearance. He was dressed with even more than his usual care and trimness wore patent-leather boots, my aversion from that hour, for these were the first I had ever seen , and lavender-colored pantaloons, very tightly strapped down over them; a glossy black coat and vest, and linen of unimpeachable quality and whiteness; while a chain of fine Venetian gold held his watch, or eye-glass, or both, in suspension from his neck. Do assure me of your health, my dear girl. "There are several," he said. Levities, mockeries rather!" "Possibly," I rejoined. He paused and surveyed me, as if in doubt of his own senses. I started from my chair and approached him, paper in hand. I forget. "What is it you object to, Miriam?" he asked, in faltering tones, as his hand fell and his glimmering eyes encountered mine. "All, every thing," I answered. "Miriam, this violence surprises me, is wholly unlooked for, and unnecessary," he remarked, mildly. "But other ties do exist, mistaken girl! "I make my running commentaries in that way, Mr. Bainrothe. These papers form the subject of your visit, I believe. He loves you, too, and proves it, for he takes you penniless. "I shall, however, make all this," he continued, "appear as well as possible to your friends and mine, especially, believe me, Miriam! , "and be restored to health and perfect reason. She, like myself, was a woman. He was looking at me wonder-struck, and, perhaps, with something like compunction in his face as I met his gaze. I said, "woman no more, you have unsexed yourself. he asked at length. "It seems so, Ernieâ"yet oh, no, no! he asked, leaning with both arms on my lap and putting up his hand to touch my face. "Yes, very cruelly, Ernie." I asked, as I watched the workings of his expressive face. He looked at his small hands and arms, then extended them wistfully. "And who gave you the flowers, Ernie?" I asked, receiving them from his generous hands as I spoke, and raising the white roses to my nostrils to inhale their delicate breath, "Did Ady give you these?" he answered, solemnly. Poor Angy could not fly. The face of one of the angels in the transfiguration did, indeed, resemble Mabel's. Darling, darling! "Dar, now! Whisper that, and tell me the rest afterward." How much would dat watch and chain be worth, honey?" This confinement is wearing us both out; it will be the death of me, and you will be to blame." "The sooner the better," I rejoined, heartlessly. Mebbe she's dyin', chile, an' ef she isâ"but no!" It opened outwardly, and could have been readily so secured. Ernie, too, slumbered peacefully. The study alone formed a small lateral projection on the other hand. Yet, after all, perhaps, I miscalculated. "I really cannot inform you where she is," I answered, petulantly. "But how did she get out, Miss Harz?" "So she assured you we were both prisoners by night, did she? Well, I am glad you have proof at last of what I told you." Do you feel better for my laying on of hands? You don't think it amounts to that, do you? "I do not knowâ"either that or die, I supposeâ"whichever God pleases. I am weary of being a prisonerâ"weary of you, of every thing about me. That these were all confederated I could not doubt, and prepared to aid each other. My health, too, was giving way. My strength, my energy were falling. It seemed to me that, long ere this, Wardour Wentworth must have ascertained my fate, and the thought that he might be passive when my very soul was at stake, thrilled me with agony unspeakable. To this, at last, I consented. 'Straws show,' you know, etc. "You remember the French song which I was always fond of humming, 'OÃ¹ est on si bien qu'au sein de sa famille?' "He seems a gentlemanly person enough, but may be an impostor for aught I know. The man has gone to California, and will probably return no more. "Did you, or did you not, meet this person at Colonel La Vigne's? "She was quite shocked at her uncle's wild behavior, and positively refused to go with him, is fond of Mr. Gregory, and remembers you with affection. I prefer, myself, the Indian notion of eating, seldom, and enough at a time. Yet the philosophers tell us man's necessity for food lies at the root of civilization, and that the desire for a sufficiency and variety of aliment alone keeps up our energies! "Oh, I had forgotten about that! "You reside here, then?" "Oh, no, you quite misunderstand me. "He has been absent, but has just returned. Bainrothe." "There is no question of him now," I responded, gravely, purposely misunderstanding her; "he has been married some time to my step-sister, Evelyn Erie, and, I suppose, with many of my other friends, believes me dead!" "Oh, no, I assure you," she rejoined, with some confusion, "it is a mistake altogether. "There was contrivance, then; you admit that!" I said, impressively. . Yet there was food for consideration here, and extremest terror. I asked, coldly, after consideration. "If Mr. Gregory loved me truly, he would not limit me thus," I hazarded. "When shall he come to you, and speak for himself? "I know his fastidiousness on this subject, and from this time it ought to, it must be my study to try to please him." rang in my ears, and seemed written on the wall. Oh! lef' us pass, ole Masta, Oh! lef' us pass, strong Masta, Oh! lef' us pass, rich Mastaâ" 'T am near de break ob day! lef' us pass, ole Masta, Oh! lef' us pass, kin' Masta, Oh! lef' us pass, sweet Masta, For we is mighty late!

Wat does dat mean, honey?" "I can scarcely make you understand now, Dinah" aside . "Don't ask meâ"just go on, low, very low; how did you hear all this?" Aloud "More cream, Dinah." "Wid my ear to de key-hole, in de study, war dey axed de osaifer. "Sartin an' sure I does when de right time is come,' I sez. Dat's our colored way for reformation, child. he! he!" "Oh, go at once, Dinah, and open the door for Mrs. Raymond. "That will do, Dinah. "Now, tell me about McDermot, Dinah, what sort of a look has he? Is he large or small, light or dark, and does he smoke a pipe?" It seemed my only hope to enlist this man on my side, either through his sympathies or sense of duty. I did not possess a stiver in that prison, nor own even the clothes on my back. Wat I does for you, chile, I does for lub ob yo purliteness" hesitating here . "Is dat ring of yours good guinea gole, honey?" asked the mercenary creature, leering at it. But mebbe its nuffin but pinchbeck, after all." Now, listen and understand me. Do you understand this, Dinah? If so, repeat it to me low, yet distinctly." "Did you speak with him, Dinah?" "Dere was no use, honey; Bainrothe done bought him up. Alas, my dear! The amazement of Dinah at this change in the programme, if possible, exceeded my own. "Yes, fortunately I have two almost alike. Which shall it be, a chally or barege?" "It matters little, the color is all I care for. I asked, desperately. She, at least, I thought, may be compassionate. It is that girl, then, who has given us all this trouble," going to the bed, "when I did not suppose she knew of her existence. Explain this, Clayton, if you can." The farce was to be kept up, it seemed, to the end. he! he! "Somewhatâ"it is my head to-night, however, that troubles me chiefly. Ah, that is great relief! "Pardon me, I was thinking. This is a crisis, you knowâ"this night decides my fate for good or ill, all rests with merciful God!" "Yes, allâ"of ourselves we are helpless, of course. you would not, I trust. "Oh, not for worlds! be still, the pain will pass. "It must not comeâ"see, we are all alone!" "Get up," I said, and yet without willing that she should do so. It is sweet, too, to think that she will be married at last. it was no fault of hers, thoughâ"no fault. As I did so, the clock struck eight. I commenced, very cautiously, to descend them. The study-door at their foot was closed, and all seemed silent within. This was despair. "I was mistaken, 'Stasia, it is not he! Do as you like, though." This was the rejoinder made from within the study, in which I recognized the voice of Mrs. Raymond, clear and shrill. "Well, have it as you please. He will be here in twenty minutes, Mr. Bainrothe; but don't wait. But, perhaps"â"lingering a momentâ""you would be so good as to suffer Mr. Caleb to show me the short way you spoke of? Well, it is a strange coincidence, to say the leastâ"very strangeâ"as the doctor is so well known hereabouts. But, perhaps you had an escort to the corner?" Oh, for pity's sake, put me on my way and let me go! Ay, or even the sabot of France! It is the only alcoholic preparation that Napoleon Bonaparte Burress ever suffered to pass his temperate lips. Father Matthew does not object to it at all, I am told, on emergencies. It may be had at this repository very low, either by the gross or dozen. "Oh, no; it will be an absolute saving of time to me; but, I warn you, the alley is narrow and dark!" "Never mind; I prefer the short cut, be it what it may. "You are very considerate," he said, dryly, after we had gone a few yards in profound silence, "but had I not better return for a lantern?" "Oh, not for worlds! "Of whom are you afraid, poor young lady? "Oh, yes! Ah! and he coughed several times significantly. "The doctor will set all right, I suppose, when I give you into his hands. Don't question me further, it exhausts me to talk. "We shall soon be there," he reiterated, "no need for hurry now." I ran up the sleety steps in advance of him, and rang the bell with convulsive energy. on his profane lips, and the twain drove off as rapidly as they had come. The doctor is engaged," said the house-maid, lingering. "If one at all, merely let me know when he is ready to see me. I am tired and cold, and can wait patiently by this good fire." "It may be some time, miss; would you like a cup of hot coffee, you and this gentleman? The doctor has just had his supper, and there is a pint or more left in the urn." "That is the way of this houseâ"patients are always entertained, if in need of refreshment," said Mr. Burress, advancing to the chimney, while he rubbed his hands in a self-gratulatory manner, then expanded them before the bright glare that filled every pore with warmth. "I shall only stay a few minutes," he said, apologetically. The man spoke with an air and tone of truth; the sketch was unmistakably hers. O friends, have you forgotten me?" Life is full of bathos as well as pathos. "I thank you, I bless you," he said, at last. "I do not hope to be able to return such services, but, what I can do, command." this is too much; it is, indeed!" Well, it is a great joy to me to think I helped a little to cut the ropes." Why, I owe every thing to you. Mine was in store, but how could he dream of this? "I must go, indeed, my dear sir" to Dr. Pemberton , "but this night will be memorable in my annals. "I cannot tell you, Mrs. Jessup. "Oh, yes, I know her perfectly well by sight. But Mrs. Austin I have not seen since last rose-time, and then only in passing. She seemed well, but wore a troubled face." This was joyous intelligence to me. This, at least, was a consolation. Such as these die not, but are translated, the one to hell, the other to heaven." He was my husband's patron and benefactor, and as such alone entitled to my regard; but there was more. He was occupied in making the great railroad through Jersey that was the pioneer of engineering progress, and a mighty link between two kindred States. He was in this way, though often absent, never for any length of time, and his return was always a fresh source of joy to his household. Life is full of pre-Raphaelitism, and so is fiction, if indeed it resembles lifeâ"such as we know it, or such as it might be. Our interests, too, are the same. "And what, my dear Bertie," I said, one day, when Mr. Mortimer had departed, and she came to throw herself down on the sofa in my chamber and rest, "what has reconciled you to the old Parrot, as you used to call our sublime Shakespeare?" "Yes, I know that was always a fault of mine." "That is why you married the man in the iron mask, you know. "Describe the man you think you could have loved, Bertie La Vigne." That time is past forever, child. He was my affinity, I believe, only he died before I was born. "She would like to hear that, no doubt, Bertie." "Well, she may hear it if she chooses when I go to England to read the old Parrot in the right way, under their very noses, Kembles and all. I'll let Mrs. Shelley know I'm there," and she laughed merrily. "And what is your idea of the way to read Shakespeare, Bertie dear?" I asked, playfully. Why, Miriam, he knew himself better than we knew him. He was a sort of artesian well of a man, and could not help spouting platitudes, that was all. It is the fashion to crack him up like the Bible, both encyclopÃ¦dias, that's all! "No, I am not; only genuine. "Miriam," she said, after a while, "life is a humbug. "Poor child, poor child!" "Doesn't that describe me as I am, Miriam?" "You are, indeed, much changed, Bertie; perhaps it would be well could you confide in me." "No, it would not be well! A long serpent, truly!" I am determined to be famous, rich, beautiful!" 'He who laughs best, laughs last!' "The very prospect transfigures you, Bertie. No, Miriam! So best, I felt! "The very word for her," he replied; "only that and nothing more." "Well, love!" "What would you have me say, dear? and he laughed. "Ah! "She is too fine an actress for that, Miriam; only transfigured." "Yes, I see what you mean" sadly . Whom does she resemble, Wardour? "She said she would be, and she has succeeded!" The otherâ"O, Miriam, to think of him is crime; but in his life, and that alone, I live. This was all. By order of Colonel Favraud, they were buried in one grave. I love their aromatic odors, reminding one of balm and frankincense, and the great Temple of Solomon itself, built of fine cedar-wood. He is said, however, to have spells of melancholy. Of Gregory, we never heard. the truth. "She was one of Swedenborg's angels, Major Favraudâ"no real wife of yours. "I believe you are half right," he said, sadly. "Suggest one, then. Come, help me to a wife." "No, no, I can make no matches; but you know Madame de St. Aube is a widow now. No, that will never do. "I do not fancy such. Because she was disappointed once, is that a reason? Cut it out, Mrs. Wentworth, and cast it to the seals in the bay. "I must not ask you, I feel, for you say you cannot tell me more in honor, but I think I know. The man, of all the earth, I would have chosen for her. Oh, hard is woman's fate!" I love them both, yet I feel they are mismated, even if happy. This is his maxim. Such as his life is, he accepts it manfully; and in his shadow I find protection and grow strong. Reader, farewell!
