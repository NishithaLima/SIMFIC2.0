 There they stood still, a fortune in themselves. He worships my beautiful young mother, and he worshiped me. She was more beautiful than a picture, with her golden hair and fair face, her sweeping dresses and trailing laces. "Mamma," I said to her, one day, "it is just like coming to heaven when you call me to walk with you." They said she was like an angel in the house; so young, so fair, so sweetâ"so young, yet, in her wise, sweet way, a mother and friend to the whole household. "Then you cannot judge. "You would. "I am not as strong as you, Isabel," she said, gently, "and I love Sir Roland with my whole heart." I did not like to address any questions to my parents on the subject, lest they should wonder why the subject interested me. How my beautiful mother looked at me. "I am very surprised: it is such a strange question for my Laura to ask! "Mind the lace and diamonds, Laura," he cried. "How well you looked, Beatrice," said my father. "How well I felt," she replied. I should like dancing parties a little oftener; they are much more amusing than your solemn dinner parties." But, ah me! She was gay and charming herself, laughing at the fuss, anxiety and care. Oh, let me go to her!" A quiet, beautiful Christmas. She was never tired, and I wondered why that story, more than any other, interested her so greatly. "Mamma, darling," I asked, "are you very ill?" "Why, Laura?" she questioned. "But I will, Laura. "Oh, Emma, what a strange night it has been! "No, my dear," she replied. "Emma, you should not tell stories!" said my good nurse; "I have told no storiesâ"I speak the truth; there is nothing wrong. I persisted. "I am not my lady's maid, missie," she replied. I went in and sprang to my father's armsâ"my own clasped together round his neckâ"looking eagerly in his face. Ah, me! "Oh, not to her!" "Mamma is living," he said, and I broke from his arms. Ah, my darling, it would have been better had you died then. "Laura," said my father, gravely, "you must try and control yourself. You are only a child, I know, but it is just possible"â"and here his voice quiveredâ""it is just possible that you might be useful to your mother." Then he took me in his arms. You have had a little brother, but he only lived one hour. I was not frightened; the beautiful, tiny face, now still in death, had no horrors for me. I should like to have seen his pretty eyes and to have seen him just once with him lips parted; as it was, they were closed in the sweet, silent smile of death. I kissed the sweet, baby face again and again. "Good-by, my little brother," I said. "There sleeps my little son and heir, Laura," he said to meâ""my little boy. I should not have known her; a pale, languid lady lay there in the place of my laughing, beautiful mother; two large blue eyes full of tears looked at me; two thin, white arms clasped me, and then I was lying on my mother's heart. They said I must be patient, it would come in time. But, alas! it was weary waiting; the days seemed as weeks to me, and yet my dear, beautiful mother was still confined to her room and to her bed. "I feel better this morning," she said. Ah, me! it was the old story over again, of silent gloom and anxious care. She was to be a hopeless, helpless cripple. cried my father. "I dare not." "Laura," he said, "you must help me all your life to take care of mamma." "I will, indeed," I cried. I did it. She was always talking about them and saying where she should go and what she should do when she grew well. "I will drive you down any time you like." But my mother said nothing. "No, my darling, not just yet," he replied. After a time visitors came, and my mother saw them; the poor came, and she consoled them. "My lady" was with them once more, never more to walk into their cottages and look at the rosy children. They came to her now, and that room became a haven of refuge. "What a paragon!" cried my father, as he read through the list of virtues. "I hope we shall not be disappointed," said my mother. She was to be with us on the seventh, and the whole of the day was like a tempest; the wind blew, the rain fell. "And this is my pupil," she said. "I hope we shall be good friends." I looked across at my father. "I am afraid," she said, "that I deserve rebuke. "You are very kind," she said to Miss Reinhart, "but I am weak and nervous; so little tires me." "Yes, it is very sad," she answered, in cold, sweet tones. I hated her voice, I hated her sweetness, I hated her. "Laura," said Sir Roland, "will you take Miss Reinhart to her room?" "I cannot leave mamma," I said. "Please do not ask me." "Laura can never leave her mother," he said. She went, and my father was quite silent for some minutes afterward. "She is not half so beautiful as mamma," I cried. "You are all-sufficient to me. "I hope," he said, "to interest you in the whole place. "I will always do my very best for you, Sir Roland," she said, earnestly, and I could feel in some vague way that she was sympathizing with him and pitying him in a way that was against my mother's interests. "We will talk about it later on," he said. "I have no doubt but that you are quite right." she said. "I will cheerfully and gladly do everything and anything I can," she said, "to help you. As for things going wrong, it was not trueâ"my mother, from her sofa, ordered the household, and I knew there was nothing wrong. I should have said much more, but that my father placed his hand over my mouth. little one," he said. "I am afraid I give you too much license." I believe my heart would have broken but for Emma, my nurse. cried my nurse; "why of course she is. You are not reasonable or patient; try to make the best of it. "Oh, Emma!" I did not want any education, I am sure." "I have heard," she said, "that my lady is wonderfully clever. I did keep it, and Heaven knows how much it cost me. He laughed. "What an energetic scholar," he cried. said Emma, when she heard of it. I was very quick and appreciative. I am sure that he loved my mother with greatest affection: that her illness made her all the more dear to him, and that he looked upon it as a trial equally great for both of them; he loved her the more for it, and he devoted himself to her to make up to her as much as he could for the privations that she had to undergo. As for pitying himself, such an idea never occurred to him; of that I am certain. I was but a child, and could not interest him very much. Young as I was, I was struck with her animation and verve. But it was not to me he talked. she would ask. "I am afraid there is little difference and no improvement," was his reply. "No," he would answer with a sigh. "Oh, no! "What a disappointment to you," she cried. "You must feel these things sorely." I am sure you might go if you would. "I have never left her for so long, and never alone." She was most amiable and unselfish, and told him what was perfectly trueâ"that she was delighted, and that if he would begin to go out without her she would be most happy. But it was so, and my poor, dear mother did not know it. "There is no one to look after her," he said, with a deep sigh. "I will speak to Lady Tayne about it. "Miss Reinhart thinks so," said my mother, in those clear, gentle tones I knew so well; "but then, Roland, what can Miss Reinhart know about our household matters?" "I do not care about that," she said, plaintively. I should not like to lose her. If you do not decidedly wish it, it shall never be done." "You are so good to me," she said, gently. I am sure you will not." "You are very kind to offer," he said. She cannot possibly help it, and it distresses her. "It would really be a kindness," he said, "and I am very grateful to you indeed. Ours did not. "I have lived here, the most faithful and devoted of servants, for more than fifty years. she said. "I have never wronged you. "I have nothing to do with it," she replied coldly. "I will tell Sir Roland that you desire to leaveâ"there my business ends." "I will word your message just as you wish," she said; "there shall be no mistake." I believe, honestly, that from that time she tried to make things worse. As for any reference to her, she never thought of it. "Miss Reinhart," I asked her one morning. "I am a very old child," I replied, with a sigh. "Certainly, my Laura," he replied. He looked dreadfully shocked. he said. Certainly not. She ingratiated herself by degrees. Then his accounts. I went in several times and found them seated at the table, side by side, with papers, ledgers and books, yet not so deeply engrossed but that every now and then they had a jest and a merry laugh. If you will permit me, I will smoke my cigar. Will you come, Laura?" Ah, me! "I wish papa would go with me, Laura," she said. Ah, heaven! "My lady," she said, "do pray be calm. "I will remember," she said. "Where is papa, darling?" "I have only seen him once to-day." "He is still in the dining-room, mamma." "I will go and sit with Lady Tayne," he said. Then he glanced at the beautiful, brilliant face of Sara Reinhart. "Laura, why are you not sitting with your mother to-night?" Come on, Laura." "How good you are, Sir Roland," she said, impulsively. "You are so self-sacrificing. The evenings are very long." He looked irresolutely at her. "You must find them very long," he said. "I am very sorry." "It cannot be helped," she answered. "I have always heard that the nights in the country were twice as long as those in town. I believe it." He knew it as well, I am sure, from the look on his face. You are fifteen, and you are no longer a child. I looked at her. I would not say one word against Sir Roland for all the world. "I will do it always," I said, and then, looking up, I saw that my nurse was sad and grave. "How will it end, Emma?" "Only God knows, miss," she replied. She was very particular about going to church, and every Sunday morning, whether Sir Roland went or not, she drove over to the church and took me with her. she said. My eyes closed, and drowsy languor fell over me. said my nurse, "Miss Laura is asleep." I was not quite, but I did not feel able to contradict them. "I will not wake missie, but I want to speak to you," she said. "I am in great trouble, Emma. "Go, I suppose," said Emma. "It does not matter to us," said Emma. "Yes, it does matter," persisted the other. My duty is to them." "Do not say any more," I cried. "I am not asleep, and I understand it all." cried Alice, aghast. "It does not matter, Alice," I said. "No," was the quiet reply, "I do not. he asked. Oh, papa, she has taken you from us." "My poor child! Then he kissed me. "Let her go, that we may be happy as we were before. Oh, papa! "Laura, run away, child, and remember what I have said. I saw him ride out of the courtyard and did not see him return. I went quietly along the broad corridors to my father's study. I went in. "It must be so," he said; "there is no alternative now." She clung to him, whispering, and he kissed her. my injured, innocent mother. "Laura, you do not look so cheerful this evening. I would not believe it. I am sure it is not true." "Even if it should be I do not know what we could do," said Emma. Emma came in reply. "I have not seen him either," she said. We talked about him. The rector said Lady Tayne was tired, and must have some wine. But my mother clung to me. Oh, Heaven! "I am afraid it is but too true," he replied. "My servants," she said, mechanically. "I knew it would kill her," said the rector. "I am afraid so," he replied. They raised her and carried her to her room; they laid her down, and the rector drew me to her. I did. But, oh, Heaven! "She is with the angels of heaven," said the rector, gently. "My poor child, come away." Now it is all over, and she is at rest. Emma sat by me. I saw her once again. The rector stood there with me. "No; I do not know." After a long time I did it. I forgave them. She was buried.
