 And in one sense I may claim to have invented the business of the scene. âIt seems as if it were going on all night,â? I said for the sake of saying something; âtheatrical and artificial, you know. I began, stupidly, to recall the names of such flowers as bluebell, hare-bell, Canterbury-bell. did she?â? I commented automatically, and cursed myself for having conveyed a warmth of interest I certainly did not feel. Brenda, I mean,â? âI had a kind of premonition that it was going to, as soon as it began,â? I remarked with stupid politeness to Miss Tattersall. she told me. âMrs. she continued. Yes,â? I agreed, as if I were bound to admire her originality. They are afraid of the night-air, my allegory went on, and having begun their retreat, they are now sending out their servant for help. I began to wonder if I were composing the plot of a grand opera? And he came down to the central cluster of faintly irritated Sturtons and Jervaises, with an evident hesitation that marked the gravity of his message. âQuite hopelessly, eh?â? âIn any case,â? She looked at her husband for approval. quite, quite,â? âA beautiful night. She insisted. âTell him to bring the motor round,â? was my companionâs translation of the general feeling. âIf they have to wake up the chauffeur,â? âOh!â? she apologised for the seventh time. âPerhaps the chauffeur has followed the example of Carter, and afterwards hidden his shame,â? I suggested. âOh, noâ? âHe isnât the least that sort of man.â? I replied. âWe might almost as well go and sit down somewhere,â? I suggested to Miss Tattersall, and noted three or four accessible blanks on the staircase. âAlmost,â? Hughes was reputed âbrilliantly clever.â? now,â? âFifty to one against another dance, then,â? How?â? âTake âem home in your car,â? âDead the other way,â? âYou might easily run them over to the vicarage and be back again in twenty minutes.â? âBy Jove; yes. So I might,â? Do you think â¦ could any oneâ¦â? Hughes asked. âNo, thanks. But it was Gordon Hughes who demonstrated his power of quick inference and response, although in doing it he overstepped the bounds of decency by giving a voice to our suspicions. Your own car?â? âYes. Rather. Of course,â? Hughes insisted. I began as soon as we had got our whiskies and lighted cigarettes. Hughes drank with a careful slowness, put his glass down with superfluous accuracy, and then after another instant of tremendous deliberation, said, âWhat is?â? I said. I began to lose patience with him. I said. Do you know him at all?â? Hughes answered after another solemn deliberation. And he had been the first person to point the general suspicion a few minutes earlier, by his inquiry about the motor. I remarked. Hughes stroked his long thin nose with his thumb and forefinger. I asked. âBut, good heavens, if heâs that sort of manâ¦â? I suggested. Hughes replied. Hughes asked. âNo, I want Melhuish,â? I prompted him. Hughes put in, but did not attempt to get himself out of it. no; rather not,â? I agreed gladly. Yet, it was not very dark. As we came out of the park, Jervaise took my arm. âTell me as little or as much as you like,â? I responded. âYou know that Iâ¦â? he agreed warmly, and added, âIâd sooner Hughes didnât know.â? âHe guesses a lot, though,â? I put in. âI suppose they all do.â? âWho are we going to see?â? I asked. âSounds just like a pump,â? I said thoughtlessly. âSorry,â? I said. âI didnât mean to play the fool. But you must admit that it had a queer sound.â? I repeated the adjectival sentence under my breath. all serene,â? I asked, quite at a loss. I inquired irritably. Havenât even seen him, now. he replied quite amicably. âYou see, this chap, Banks,â? And this chap, Banks, the son, has knocked about the world, no end. I asked. âLord, no. I asked. âAbout twenty-five.â? âAnd his sister?â? âRather younger than that,â? âRather.â? âI suppose it would be very terrible for you all if she married this chap?â? I said. âIt would be worse in a way than your marrying the sister?â? I asked. âNo,â? âOh!â? I began to wish that he had not seen fit to confide in me. I suggested. I tried another line. âAnd if you find your sister up at the Home Farm; and Banks; what are you going to do?â? âKick him and bring her home,â? I replied. âObviously,â? âDamn it all, itâs beginning to rain like blazes,â? I asked. was his comment. âVery far up,â? I asked. âDamned odd,â? she asked quietly. I ought to have taken up the key of high romance. I explained. âRather an upset down at the Hall, Miss Banks; about Brenda,â? âLike anything,â? âIs it so very important?â? No one but a fool would have called her âpretty.â? She looked up at him with the most charming insouciance when he paused so portentously at the very opening of his address. âWhen?â? Precisely!â? asked Jervaise. âNo, certainly not! âNo!â? horribly,â? âYou see, we canât find your brother, either,â? âYou donât think it conceivable that Brendaâ¦â? âYes?â? asked Anne. âYou havenât told me anything, yet, have you? I joined in the conversation, then, for the first time. I said. âAnd wouldnât itâ"I hardly know her, Iâll admitâ"but wouldnât it be rather like your sister?â? âYou see, my dear chap,â? âYou donât know anything about it,â? âBut, Mr. Jervaise,â? I asked myself irritably. Do you mind telling me how you know?â? âBy intuition,â? âLately! Where?â? yes, I know that. âNo, I didnât mean that,â? I began to wonder if my first estimate of herâ"based to a certain extent, perhaps, on Jervaiseâs admission that she did not like himâ"had not been considerably too high. âWe might add, Miss Banks,â? I put in, âthat weâve been making a perfectly absurd fuss about nothing at all. She looked at me, then, for the first time since I had come into the house; and I saw the impulse to some tart response flicker in her face and die away unexpressed. I agreed. âI suppose her father and mother and the servants, and so on, heard her let us in,â? I said. my good man,â? âI put it to you,â? I asked. âCommon curiosity would be a sufficient inducement, I should imagine,â? It isnât usual, you knowâ"outside the theatrical world, perhaps.â? I tried, fully aware of the inanity of my suggestion. I asked in the tone of one ready to discount any possible explanation he might have to make. âThere can be only one. âAnd had warned all her peopleâ¦â? he remarked in the complacent tone of one who waits to formulate an unimpeachable theory. How?â? I asked. âHm!â? I commented, and added, âIt still makes Miss Banks appear ratherâ"double-faced.â? Lord!â? I agreed petulantly. âI believe that Miss Banks had some good reason for being so sure that we should find her there.â? âYou havenât made a bad case,â? I conceded; âbut I differ as to your last inference.â? âYou donât think we shall find Brenda at home?â? I replied aggressively. I said. He confessed to no one but me. And I saw, now, just the same boyish dread and perplexity that I had seen when he made his confession to me at Oakstone. âYou know, Melhuish,â? I asked. But it has been going on a long timeâ"weeks, anyhow. She wanted me to talk to B. about it. âTheoretically, yes!â? put the neighbours first,â? I exclaimed. âYou donât understand what the idea of family means to people like my father and mother. I put in, a trifle shocked by the idea of the scandal, and then discovered that he had not been thinking of Brenda. âPerhaps not in that case,â? I asked. âKick him and bring her home,â? That, and the moon. âComplicated or simplified?â? I suggested. âComplicated; damnably complicated,â? he replied irritably. It isnât as if she were in earnest.â? I asked, remembering his âI donât know. How can any one know,â? he equivocated. I asked. âNot in that way, Brendaâs way,â? I commented. I added thoughtfully. he remarked, âbut thereâs no getting over the fact that heâs our chauffeur.â? I asked. I exclaimed. I enunciated. I said. âIf it is, then every impulse towards beauty and freedom is rot, too.â? It is not, indeed, surprising that that should be my reaction while the hurt of his sneer still smarted. âIf she hasnât come backâ¦â? I replied. âNo use trying to find her, of course,â? he agreed, irritably, âbut weâd better talk things over with the governor.â? I remarked elliptically. âYou wonât be if you start that transcendental rot,â? I asked. âCommon sense,â? I agreed. âWho did you see?â? âYou are quite sure that Brenda hadnât been there?â? no, I didnât. How do you know?â? âIt was so impossible to believe that she would do a thing like that,â? we can catch him,â? âWe canât advertise it all over the county that he has gone off with Brenda.â? âIt was so unfortunate that the Atkinsons should have been here,â? she remarked. âEvery one will know, in any case,â? âThere is so little real evidence, at present,â? asked Ronnie. âNot legally,â? âBut, as Mr. Melhuish says,â? I tried, âwhether Miss Jervaise might not have been moved by a sudden desire to drive the car by moonlightâ¦â? So she may!â? Olive echoed. âIt would be so like Brenda.â? âOr gone a lot farther than she originally meant to,â? âIt seems to me,â? âThere is a limit to this kind of thing,â? I joined young Turnbull. I explained. âIt was only a casual suggestion.â? âJolly convincing one, though,â? I argued. he suggested, âand changed her mind when she got outside. âIf she ever did,â? I put in unwisely, thereby provoking a repetition of the evidence afforded by Miss Banksâs behaviour, particularly the damning fact that she, alone, had responded to Racquetâs demand for our instant annihilation. My one longing was to get back, alone, into the night. âOh, dear!â? she apologised. âNo, really not,â? âRather, letâs get a drink,â? âGo on, mater,â? And he went up to her, kissed her in the mechanical way of most grown-up sons, and gently urged her in the direction of the stairs. âYes. Bedâs the best place, just now,â? I lied. It isnât one man in a million who can whistle absolutely true. For beauty lives with kindness. I tried to picture my own emotions as the truth was slowly borne in upon me that some unprecedented calamity had silently and without any premonition befallen the whole world of men. I said. âWho are you looking for?â? âNot so much who as what,â? I said. âAnd even then it isnât so easy to define. Like a long run on the red, you know.â? Go on.â? âAnd the more you learn the nearer you are to the deadly ability of being able to foretell the future. âHm!â? âYou donât agree with that?â? I asked. âOh, practically! I replied with a hint of contempt for anything so common. He gave a little self-conscious laugh. âYou canât get away from the practical in this life,â? âYou may dream half the night,â? âYou think the world might be ârun,â at least, more interestingly?â? I put in. âMore sensibly,â? âThereâs no sense in it, the way we look at things. I tried tentatively. âYou know who I am, I suppose?â? âNo idea,â? I said. I tried to convey the effect that I still waited to be shocked. âI suppose youâre staying up at the Hall?â? âIn a way. âNot since?â? âWho?â? I asked. No. âAbout four. âNot back, eh?â? âYou donât know where she is, then?â? âYou are quite right,â? I said. âAnd I would sooner you gave me no confidences, now I come to think of it. I donât know myself, you see.â? I asked. I began. âOh, no!â? But you can see for yourself that itâs better I shouldnât. âOh, quite,â? I agreed, and added, âIâll stay and see the sun rise.â? âYou wonât see the sun for some time,â? he remarked. âThereâll be a lot of cloud and mist for it to break through. I replied; and for a few minutes we discussed weather signs like any other conventional Englishmen. âThereâs room to turn round in Canada without hitting up against a notice board and trespassing on the preserves of some landed proprietor. Anyhow my father did. Weâve been their tenants for God knows how many hundred years. And serfs before that, I suppose. I get the feeling myself, sometimes. âAnd yet,â? I commented. Would, too. Well, would you call that playing fair?â? I said with emphasis. âMost people would,â? he replied gloomily. I asked. âNo good my compromising you, just now,â? I said. he replied with a whimsical twist of his firm mouth. âThere is a quality about these Bankses,â? I began to wonder how far I had dramatised and distorted the actual events by the exercise of a romantic imagination? Henâ¦.â? I began to mumble something, but she went on, right over me, speaking in a voice that she obviously meant to carry âAnd Brenda isnât down even now,â? She has the beginning of a nasty cold brought on by her foolishnessâ"and, besides, she has been very, very naughty and will have to be punished.â? I began to feel an emotional glow of sympathy for him in his distress. I began to wish that I had not been quite so friendly with Mr. Banks. I replied, to avoid the possible embarrassment of her comments should I admit to having slept in the open air; and then John and a female acolyte came in with the long-desired material of breakfast. I commented softly. âYou deserve to go without breakfast for having missed prayers,â? âLater on,â? I agreed with a touch of eagerness and followed her, wondering if her intriguing sentence before breakfast had been nothing more than a clever piece of chicane, planned to entice me into a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. was my opening. âDidnât you know?â? she replied. I put in with the usual inanity that is essential to the maintenance of this kind of conversation. I commented; sincerely, this time; and with a thought of my socialist friend Banks. I remarked. I asked. âCertainly it would. I prompted her. âNo conveyance,â? âThere arenât any Sunday trains on the loop line, Hurley Junction is fifteen miles away, and the Jervaisesâ car is Heaven knows where and the only other that is borrowable, Mr. Turnbullâs, is derelict just outside the Park gates.â? âAnd the horses?â? I suggested. âAnd nothing else would be big enough for four people and their luggage. She looked up at me, trying to guess how far I was honest in that remark. âMrs. âIt would be too risky to deceive us as crudely as that,â? I said. she broke in with a flash of temper, âbut she hasnât come back.â? I began. I conceded. I said. She looked up at me with a question in her face, but I did not understand until she spoke, that what had been keeping back her confession was not doubt of my trustworthiness but her fear of losing my good opinion. âYou will,â? I said. I put in. I persisted. âAnd this happened?â? I suggested. âJust before I came down to prayers,â? she replied. I asked. They are probably in London, by now.â? I added. it wasnât his fault,â? âHe was just infatuated, poor fool. âI suppose heâs a weak sort of chap?â? I said. âNo. It isnât that,â? I said. âWhy? Who?â? âWho is it?â? she repeated with a hint of testiness. she repeated; âbut how did you know? âJust an intuition,â? she remarked coldly. for Brenda. âSo youâre not coming with us, Mr. Melhuish?â? I replied with, I hope, a proper air of courtesy. I put it all down to my failure in piety, begun with my absence from prayers and now accentuated by my absence from church. I agree that my premises were faulty, far too lightly supported, but my mind leapt to the deduction that the mechanic in this connection could be none other than Banks. I began to hurry, then. âA plague on both your houses,â? I said. âVery late, Mr. Melhuish,â? âMr. âHe is a very able man; very able,â? âYou are lucky to have such a good man as vicar,â? I said. Now, my story of that curate is thoroughly sound. Yes, quite a coincidence,â? I said genially, addressing the dangerous-looking profile of my hostess. And I saw that my late confidante, the user of keyholes, was faintly smiling to herself with an unmistakable air of malicious satisfaction. It must have shown then, for Jervaise was visibly uncomfortable. âJolly well your own fault, anyway.â? I demanded. âWe canât talk here,â? âVery well,â? I agreed. âYou admit that you didnât?â? âYou admit that you didnât sleep in the house?â? I replied. âYou were very late coming down,â? âGo on,â? I said. âYou were seen coming into the house after eight oâclock in the morning,â? I asked. he concluded wearily, as if to say, âMy good idiot, why persist in this damning assumption of innocence?â? I remarked. âI suppose the thing came up in some arrangement of household affairs.â? âVery likely,â? I agreed; âbut why did your mother tell you?â? look here, Melhuish,â? I asked. âNot in ordinary circumstances,â? âI havenât, but I donât see what the deuce itâs got to do with me,â? I said. I said. I began, âalthough I donât think you and your family had any right whatever to be so damnably rude to me at lunch, on the mere spiteful accusations of Miss Tattersall.â? âVery well, then, answer the question you shirked just now,â? I retorted. âYou asked me not to beat about the bush, a minute ago,â? he replied calmly, with a cunning that nearly trapped me. come,â? I interrupted him. I said. he admitted. I replied by way of finally confirming his admission. I asked passionately. âAnd why did you spy on me this morning?â? âYou donât believe me?â? I said. âCandidly, I donât,â? he replied. go to hell,â? I said savagely. He gave me none. And he dared not risk it. No one was in sight. well,â? I said to myself at last. âI suppose itâs got to be done,â? I began to compose that telegram in my mind as I threw off the tarpaulin preparatory to starting the car. I said. I ought to have wept, but instead of that I laughed. âBut, honestly, no kidâ¦â? he remarked. itâs all perfectly true, in effect,â? I said. I said nothing about it to them, you understand; and then they found out that I hadnât slept in the house, and Miss Tattersall discovered by accident that I knew you by sightâ"that was when you came up to the house this morningâ"and after that everything Iâve ever done since infancy has somehow gone to prove that my single ambition in life has always been to help you in abducting Brenda Jervaise. âNo getting back to London to-night,â? I asked. âThereâs nothing decent nearer than Godbury,â? I said. was my only comment. âYou donât mean as theyâve actually turned you out?â? I explained. he suggested. âAnd ask them to lend me the motor?â? âPerhaps not. I donât mind using the bally thingâ"they owe me thatâ"but Iâm not going to ask them for it.â? I retorted. I commented, sharpening his image for him. âBlue with funk,â? I remarked. yes,â? I asked. âYou donât want to go?â? I said. he replied. I asked. He shook his head. âThereâs one pubâ"a sort of beerhouseâ"but they donât take people in,â? I persisted. he replied. âTo the Home Farm?â? I replied stupidly. âI suppose it would put you in the wrong, as it wereâ"up at the Hall,â? I said earnestly. âOnly a farm, of courseâ¦â? I interposed quickly. âFact is, I suppose,â? Had enough of it, no doubt?â? And I should go on, as I had begun. I said. thatâd be all right,â? âThereâs nothing I should like better than to stay with you,â? âNot yet. âBut, then, look here, Banks,â? I said. âYou wonât want a stranger up there to-night of all nightsâ"interfering with yourâ"erâ"family council.â? âI dunno,â? âI didnât,â? I replied. He shook his head. âWe meant to go off together and chance it,â? Came to tell me it was all off. Well, we talkedâ¦. âAnd it isnât all off?â? I put in. âQuite sureâ"that is, if you want to tell me,â? I said. âAnd if Iâm coming home with you, it might be as well if I knew exactly how things stand.â? he remarked shyly. âSo did I,â? I rejoined, not less shy than he was. âAnd then she was afraid?â? âNo, it was rather the other way round. You see, I thought I should take all the blame off the old man by going off with herâ"him being away and all, I didnât think as even the Jervaises could very well blame it on to him, overlooking what she pointed out, as once weâd gone theyâd simply have to get rid of him, too, blame or no blame. I ought to have seen that, but one forgets these things at the time.â? âSo what it came to,â? I agreed, and added, âbut Iâm rather sorry for him, old Jervaise. âSorry for him? You neednât be,â? âVery well, Iâll take it from you,â? I said. I asked. âAnd you?â? âMe? I put in. âYes. I forgot it last night,â? âAnd I hate to see a thing not working properly.â? I asked. âJust stick to it,â? âYou think theyâll give way?â? âDo they?â? he remarked. he proceeded. I asked. You see, I want to get the car back to the house. I said. âYou met Anne last night, didnât you? I shook my head. âIt wonât take you long to run up to the Hall and put the car in,â? I said. âBut, I canât seeâ¦â? I replied. âNot to me, though,â? I said. He laughed. âPerhaps not,â? he agreed. I remarked. âWho is it, then?â? I asked. âListen!â? âThere are two of them there,â? I dared, in the confusion, to glance at Anne, and she looked up at me at the same moment. She looked at me, I thought, with just a touch of supplication, a look that I misinterpreted as a request to use my influence in stopping this din of angry voices that was so obviously serving no useful purpose. âI suppose you think that I havenât any rightâ¦â? She spoke breathlessly, as though she were searching in the brief interlude of an exhausting struggle for some insult that would fatally wound and offend him. Banks persisted. âMy dear girl, do letâs have the thing clear,â? itâs all clear enough.â? âTo us it is,â? âYou must know that we canât do anything else.â? âAnd do you purpose to stay on here?â? âNot likely,â? âYou havenât tried yet?â? âNo, I havenât.â? âAnd you honestly thinkâ¦â? she replied. âYou donât understand,â? âYou donât,â? No one could. How?â? âNo, I wouldnât,â? âI think youâre making a ghastly mistake, Frank,â? âListening to them at all,â? It must have been very exasperating for him to stand there, roaring out his sincerest convictions and to be received by every one of us with a forbearing contempt. âMy dear Ronnie, donât be absolutely idiotic,â? he remarked. Do go!â? âAnd leave you here?â? âNot that youâre going to â¦ going to Canada,â? âYes. Yes. âYes.â? âBut, Brenda!â? Do go, now. But it was, I think, a third influence that decided the struggle for that time. âWe canât help it, can we, Arthur?â? She looked at Jervaise, then, but he had no reply ready. she remarked. itâs some romantic rot of his, I suppose,â? âI never thought it was serious.â? âBut,â? âYou would in that case explain, of course, how the misunderstanding arose?â? I put in. âI never had one,â? I said. was his grudging answer. âSpying upon us,â? asked Brenda. âBoth,â? asked Anne. âLord knows,â? She spoke to me this time. âAnd do you mean to say that they were all so horrid to you that you had to come away?â? she asked. âPrecisely that,â? I said. he replied grudgingly. âDidnât come out to meet me,â? Banks put in. I said. âYou dragged me into it in the first instance by bringing me up here last night, but since then I havenât interfered one way or the other. I said promptly, âit seemed that the only thing left for me to do was to walk to Hurley Junction; but a quarter of a mile from the Park gate I found your car drawn up by the side of the road. He brought me back to introduce me, and we found you here. Simple, isnât it?â? I put in. resent it, then,â? âNo, I canât,â? âIf it had been Olive, I could. âNot in this way,â? asked Anne. âYou know itâs no earthly, Frank,â? âMr. Banks put in. âGive me a chance to prove it, then,â? âHow?â? âOnly want to save the pater any worry I can,â? âBut, surely, it would be better for the pater to see Arthur and have done with it,â? I dare say,â? âIt will take him the best part of an hour getting the car into the garage and all that,â? he remarked, looking at me. âI must go and see about Mr. Melhuishâs room,â? he remarked, and scowled again at me. âThereâs nothing more to be said until Arthur has seen Mr. Jervaise,â? âIt wasnât about them,â? I dared to look at her, now, and her face was perfectly serious as she added, âWas it about the milk, or eggs, or anything?â? you know what I want to say,â? he snorted. we donât suspect our guests of spying,â? âVery well,â? âYes?â? Anne prompted him. âIt will hardly help your brother,â? he concluded. she asked, âor did you just come here faute de mieux?â? I began lamely. âYou donât know the Jervaises particularly well?â? I explained. I repeated. âNot because the Jervaises were so rude to you?â? she asked. I said. âBut, perhaps, he didnât tell you.â? âAnd was that the beginning of all the trouble between you and the Jervaises?â? âIn a way, it was,â? I agreed. âMrs. âLike that, by nature,â? I suggested. âPerhaps,â? âYou know that my mother was governess to Olive and Frank before she married my father?â? she continued, still with that same air of discussing some remote, detached topic. I said. pursued Anne. She has got something against them that she has never told us, but it isnât that.â? âYou donât even except Frank?â? I said. âQuite by accident, of course. âIt was a mistake,â? I donât know why I didnât.â? I asked. yes,â? I said. Up at the Hall?â? she replied. âAnd I suppose he likes, or at least respects, the Jervaises?â? I said. âNot much,â? she replied. I suggested. I asked. âTo us,â? âNot for the Jervaises as individuals,â? she amended, âbut he has for the Family. I began, but she had not the patience to wait while I finished the question. âMy mother,â? she broke in. It isnât in her blood. I said. She looked at me with a spice of mischief in her eyes. âWhy?â? she asked. I said. âRather,â? I agreed warmly. I wish it were. Of course she generally tells them in French, which helps, but Iâm no better in French than in English. âYou donât know quite how well you do it yourself,â? I said. âNot like mother,â? I donât know whether thatâs enough to explain it,â? I commented. âAnd did your motherâs step-sister go abroad with them?â? âI believe so. She has been dead for ages, now. âIn connection with you,â? I replied. âNo, I couldnât be,â? I suggested. She laughed. I asked. I said. Or in us, generally?â? âIn all of you and in the situation,â? I tried, hoping to please her. âYou canât be an insurgÃ©. I retaliated. âIt was silly to play with that foolish Jervaise man this morning. I donâtâ"think. I ought to be whipped.â? I egged them on. I put in. I asked. she asked, and I knew at once that she was, after all, in her brotherâs confidence. âNo, he gave me no idea,â? I replied. âHe couldnât ever use that,â? I suggested, as she paused. He saw it, himself,â? âIt wasnât like Arthurâ"to think of such a thing, evenâ"at ordinary times. I asked. âI havenât the least notion what it is, you see,â? itâs about old Mr. Jervaise,â? âThereâs some woman or other he goes to see in town. I donât know what they think. I remarked. âBut, surely, that really does give your brother some kind of advantage,â? She looked at me with a superb scorn. âYou donât mean to say,â? I dared in my extremity. âYou little thought what a romance you were coming into when you accepted the invitation for that week-endâ"did you?â? she asked. âAnd I very nearly refused,â? âIt was the merest chance that I accepted,â? I replied. I said. I asked. I commented. I donât think the English comedies are nearly so well done. Of course, the French have only one subject, but they are so much more witty. âNo. I said. All my life, even. And in half a dozen words she had exposed the lack of real wit in my attempts at playwriting. âYou neednât look so depressed,â? she remarked. âYou see,â? Wherever they go, I must go, too. And this does, at last, seem, in a way, a chance. Only, I canât trust myself. I began. âAnd in any case, youâre prejudiced,â? she interrupted me. I asked. I offered to, but he didnât want me to come. On a charge of abduction, you know.â? I agreed. âMr. Melhuish is half asleep,â? âAnd I havenât got his room ready after all this time.â? âYou might find something to read there, unless youâd sooner have a nap,â? I said to Anne. âTo think out that play?â? She looked, I thought, as though she were sorry for me. I suggested to myself that I might meet Banks returning from the Hall, but my chief hope was that I might revive the romance of the night. I was âwell-off.â? I had wanted to be talked about, to be a social success. And in condemning him and his family, I must condemn myself also. I asked when I came within speaking distance. I asked, stretching out my hand for the suit-case. I commented. âYou can but you wonât,â? I replied. âYou see, it isnât so much a suit-case as a parable,â? I explained. I enlarged. âYou and I, my boy, are pals, now. he agreed. âJust habit,â? I suggested. âA mighty strong one, though,â? I replied. thatâs just it,â? âOr go alone,â? I inquired. âYou didnât see the old man?â? âAnd young Frankâ¦?â? âShoved it home for all he was worth. I asked, after a short interval of silence. I suggested. âAnd if they come after us and Iâm bagged?â? Escape them.â? Dodging about to get out of the country, somehow?â? I replied. âWe might wait,â? I said decidedly. I explained. âHe isnât so bad as some of âem,â? She knows him too well, for one thing. I said as we turned into the back premises of the Home Farm. she asked sternly. âHe carried it half the way,â? I said. But it was the other fellow who was in the ascendant when I entered the farm sitting-room in answer to the summons of a falsetto bell. He and Arthur were alone in the room when I came down and it was Arthur who, with an evident self-consciousness, introduced me. âMr. Melhuish, father,â? âPleased to meet you, Mr. Melhuish,â? âYou must forgive us, Mr. Melhuish, for being so interested in the weather. âAnd you must be starving,â? she continued rapidly. âSit down, Alfred,â? she commanded him, and in her pronunciation of his name I noticed for the first time the ripple of a French âr.â? Now, we are all very hungry and waiting for you.â? âWe call it supper,â? But it was very original, all the same.â? So English. I suggested âtrimâ? and âbien-ajustÃ©.â? âTrim, yes,â? âMy daughter tells me you are an author. He and I were discussing it, too, as we came back. âIt wouldnât do for us to keep you here, if theyâre wanting you to go back home.â? âNancy! Nancy!â? She laughingly waved her hands at him, using the same gesture with which she had commanded him to sit down. âNo, no, it wonât do. he murmured. Mr. Melhuish is on our side,â? âNancy! Nancy!â? he replied. âMr. Have no doubt of that,â? âTo take her back to the Hall,â? âBut, of course, she must go back to the Hall,â? âYou wouldnât like to get us into trouble, would you, Miss Brenda? You see,â? âAnd that might be the best thing that could happen to us, Alfred,â? They are like the green fly on the rose trees. You are a free man. As for me, I would rejoice to go.â? âNancy! Nancy!â? âBut, father, we may have to go,â? Have to?â? âWe have to think of them now. They are young and deeply in love, as you and I were once. And sixty? It is not as if you were an old man.â? she replied gently. âThere is no choice otherwise, except for them to separate.â? But it wouldnât, would it? âAnd suppose they wonât let her go?â? âAnd how in the world are you going to make âem?â? âYou did,â? âI did, father,â? âAnd you went up again this evening?â? Banks prompted him. âYes; I only saw Mr. Frank, then,â? Anne can tell you why.â? âOur maid is out, you see, Mr. Melhuish,â? Youâre about of a height, but youâre so much slighter. His single object, now, was revenge. âWe have called,â? yes, we know,â? âI have heard nothing of any gross misbehaviour.â? âIs it an offence to love unwisely, Mr. Jervaise?â? âYou must see how impossible it is for your son to dream of marrying my daughter,â? It must surely be your motto at the Hall to avoid scandalâ"at any cost. no, Mrs. Banks, certainly not,â? âAnd if she will not go with you?â? âAnd still, if she will not go?â? she asked. âI suppose my wishes donât count at all?â? âObviously they donât,â? âBut, look here, father,â? Weâve never got on, I and the rest of you. âYou know, Frankâ¦â? âMr. From me to you?â? âBe quiet, boy, you do not know what you are saying. she continued. But your temperament, yes. each other the night before. I asked, and I think I tried to convey something of resentment by my tone. âIn a way,â? I agreed politely. âIt was easier than I expected,â? âHe was so practical. He is magnificent. I asked, as she paused. And he says it isnât enough. âThere neednât be any difficulty about capital,â? I said eagerly. I said. she replied. I said. âOn any terms he likes,â? I agreed warmly. âWhy?â? I said. âI havenât known him long, of course; only a few hours altogether; butâ¦â? she prompted me. I said. I said. âYou like him so much that youâd be willing to lend him all the money he wanted, without security?â? she asked. I said. I replied. she suggested cruelly. I said. she asked passionately. I said. but it has. It must have,â? she protested. It stung me. she asked, as if she expected me to confess, now, quite in the familiar manner. I refused it. âI have only one claim on you,â? I said boldly. she replied impatiently. âYou recognised me last night.â? âI thought I did,â? âJust for a minute.â? âAnd now? I began. âTo look at,â? she interrupted me. I said. âOh!â? she commented softly. she murmured. I agreed. she asked. I said. she put in. âIt wonât fail,â? I said. âAnd youâd do all that just because youâveâ"remembered me?â? âThere was another influence,â? she asked, with the sound of new interest in her voice. I said. No one is to be the proprietor. she asked, after what seemed to me an immense interval. âNo,â? I confessed, âmuch of it was a result of what you said to me. she interrupted me. you did,â? she remarked. she asked. was my reply. âI did not know what to do then. she commented, as if she were speaking to herself. I replied. My conscience would always be reproaching me, if I did.â? she asked. I said. âAnd I mean to follow it. I donât know that I shall want to stay in Canada for the rest of my life. âGo on,â? she urged me. she put in. I said. she asked. âAnd running away from the Hall? Didnât you follow your impulses, then?â? âI suppose I did, in a way,â? I urged her. she asked. Now, I know why.â? I know, I know,â? I will. I donât mind telling you the truth, too. But you must give me time. Lots of time. Youâre so near me, now. And so new. âYou donât trust my impulses,â? I said. She laughed. she replied. I said. âAnd I have to be up before six,â? âOur Frank,â? âI must tell them,â? no, please,â?
