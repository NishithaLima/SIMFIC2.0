THE CRASH, UP TOWN Â Â Â Â LXIII. DIANA Â Â Â Â Â Â LXV. IN AND OUT Â Â Â Â Â Â LXX. DUST TO DUST Â Â Â Â Â Â Â XC. It was so very white that his fellow-merchants could not avoid a vague impression that he had taken the church on his way down town, and had so purified himself for business. In the counting-room or the meeting of directors, when his neighbors waxed furious upon raking over some outrage of that old French infidel, Tom Jefferson, as they called him, sending him and his gun-boats where no man or boat wants to go, Mr. Gray rolled his neck in his white cravat, crossed his legs, and shook his black-gaitered shoe, and beamed, and smiled, and blew his nose, and hum'd, and ha'd, and said, "Ah, yes!" "Ah, indeed?" "Quite so!" and held his tongue. he cried, rocking to and fro as he sat. So he was. Nobody suggested an insurance office, or an agency for diamond mines on Newport beach; for, although it was the era of good feeling, those ingenious infirmaries for commercial invalids were not yet invented. Why, keep a school, to be sure!â"a school!â"a school! And a school it was. But it was a very grave, quiet performance. It is to be presumed that at some period Mrs. Simcoe, whom Mr. Burt always addressed in the same manner as "Mrs. Simcoe, ma'am," had received a general system of instruction to the effect that "My grand-daughter, Miss Wayneâ"Mrs. Simcoe, ma'amâ"will marry a gentleman of wealth and position; and I expect her to be fitted to preside over his household. Yes, Mrs. Simcoe, ma'am." Not too noisy, Ellen! Mary, gently, gently, dear! Julia, carefully! They were not chattery French nurses who presided over these solemnities; they were grave, housekeeping, Mrs. Simcoe-kind of people. "Yes, my dear. "No, no, Hope; I know. Here, Cossy, come and give grandpa a kiss. Now go, dear." Permit me." "No, no, not of the boys? No, not of the boys. H'm, ha! Good-afternoon, Mr. Burt; a very good day, Sir. H'm, ha!" It was already toward sunset, and the tender golden light streamed upon the landscape like a visible benediction. They went home to talk about her. They went to bed to dream of her. they cried, and dropped the book to think of Hope. They were nearly of the same ageâ"she a few months the younger. Never, boys, never. Not at all. The boots, and the kicking, and the general walloping make him manly. But fagging concerns small boys, not large ones." retorted Gabriel, his eyes flashing, as he kept tossing the ball nervously, and catching it; "yes, that's the meanness of it: the little boy can't help himself." "By golly, I'd kick!" "Not at all," he answered; "there are some young American gentlemen I know who would be greatly benefited by being well fagged; yes, made to lie down in the dirt and lick a little of it, and fetch and carry. It was only a warm general discussion. Why, he has been through it all himself, and he's just paying it off." Abel smiled grimly as he looked round upon the boys, who did not seem at all enthusiastic for his suggestion. It was already dusk, but the summer evening is the best time for play. "In his study," answered twenty voices at once. cried Mr. Gray, "and call the big boys. "Carefully! It was a circular sheet of water, perhaps a mile in width. cried Mr. Gray, and the boat moved off, glimmering away into the darkness. They could see the vague, dark outline of the opposite shore, but none of the pretty villas that stood in graceful groves upon the banksâ"none of the little lawns that sloped, with a feeling of human sympathy, to the water. whispered the latter. "Yes," said Gabriel, "it's dreadful to be young when a man's drowning, for you can't do any thing. Nobody answered. Some felt homesick, and began to cry. "The little boys may go," said Mr. Gray. "Jim Greenidge," said he. "Who's there?" cried a voice within. "It's only me." "Who's me?" It was Abel Newt who spoke; and as Gabriel stepped in, Newt asked, abruptly, "What do you want?" "I want to speak to Jim Greenidge." "Well, there he is," replied Newt, pointing to another bed. "Come here, Gabriel. No, of course you shall not." "I'm sorry to have waked you." Nobody better understood the danger of draughts from windows, during thunder-storms, than the Doctor; nobody knew better than he that the lightning-rod upon the spire was no protection at all, but that the iron staples with which it was clamped to the building would serve, in case of a bolt's striking the church, to drive its whole force into the building. The Rev. "Clearly," said Mr. Gray. In the evening of the day on which the Doctor improved the drowning, and exhorted his hearers to be brave, Mr. Gray asked Gabriel Bennet, "Where was the text?" asked Mr. Gray. "Why, Sir," replied he, "it's nothing. "A ribbon we saw at church, Sir." "Well, whose was it?" asked Mr. Gray. "I believe it was Miss Hope Wayne's." "You believe, Gyles? "Well, Sir, the fact is that Abel Newt says she had a purple ribbon on her bonnetâ"" "She hadn't," said Gabriel, breaking in, impetuously. the text was there, was it?" asked Mr. Gray, smiling. In the evening, as the pupils were sitting in the dining-room, as usual, some chatting, some reading, others quite ready to go to bed, "Mr. Gray," said Abel to Uncle Savory, who was sitting talking with Mrs. Gray, whose hands, which were never idle, were now busily knitting. "Well, Abel." Boys, what shall we do? "Mr. Gray, it's a good while since we've tried all calling out together. the thing is this. asked he, apparently feeling for his handkerchief. It was needless to explain why, for every body saw the intended joke, and Gabriel returned instantly from the study saying that the handkerchief was not there. "No matter," said Mr. Gray. It was calmly studying him as a Roman surgeon may have watched the gladiator in the arena, while his life-blood ebbed away. In the black autumn midnights they struggled with the north winds that smote them fiercely and filled the night with uproar, while the child cowering in her bed thought of wrecks on pitiless shoresâ"of drowning mothers and hapless children. But it was not a lullabyâ"it was not a serenade. It was the croning of a Norland enchantress, and young Hope sat at her open window, looking out into the moonlight, and listening. he asked, quietly. "I will speak to him." The furniture was draped for the season in cool-colored chintz. "Well, Sir!" asked Mr. Burt. "Why, what the deuce is it, then?" "Why, Sir, as I was just saying," calmly returned Abel, "it is a personal matter altogether." cried Mr. Burt, on the edge of another paroxysm, "what the deuce does that mean? "I am one of Mr. Gray's boys, Sir," replied Abel. Who sent you here, Sir? asked Mr. Burt. "No, Sir; but Iâ"" "Then why, in Heaven's name, don't you go?" "Seen, indeed! I was told, Sir; and hearing of your wealth and old family, and so on, Sir, I was interestedâ"it was only natural, Sirâ"in all that belongs to you." your impudence stupefies me, Sir. "Place," said Abel, quietly. "Simply, Sir, that I am very fond of sketching. I am devoted to my art, Sir." "Well, Sir, the money I don't know about, but the fame!" I respect Benjamin West, Sir, of course. We all do. Old men like me don't mince matters, Sir. "Well, well. "Oh no, Sir," said Hiram, pocketing the coin. cried he, as he saw the faces of the fighters. "Oh, don't! "Oh, please! You've killed him!" It was the Burt carriage, and Hope Wayne was gazing in terror from the window. "Yes, miss," replied the man, as he ran down the steps. he said, turning upon Little Malacca, who quivered under his wrath. Hope, go up stairs!" "We must put you to bed," she said, gently, "and to-morrow you may go. "No matter," replied Mrs. Simcoe. Come in, Hiram," she added, as she heard a knock. It was profoundly still out of doors and in the house; and as he lay exhausted, the events of the last few days and months swam through his mind in misty confusion. It was large and lofty, and the paper on the wall told the story of Telemachus. "I must go," he murmured, as if he too were a phantom. It was Hope Wayne who spoke to him. About ten o'clock in the evening she knocked again gently at Gabriel's door. so manly, oh! I hope you attend to religion. Grammar, too, and general manners. I hear that you are very self-possessed, which is really good news. She declares, too, that all the Boston girls are dowdy. Miss Wayne, I hear, is very beautiful, and about your age. It is the fine old Knickerbocker family. It is a capital match. We are naturally delighted. However, my dear Abel of course cares nothing about such things, and, I have no doubt, is wickedly laughing at his mamma at this very moment for scribbling him such a long, rambling letter. I am going to Saratoga in a few daysâ"I think Fanny ought to drink the waters. I told Dr. Lush I was perfectly sure of it; so he told your father, and he has consented. She is only fourteen, I believe. By-the-by, now old is Sligo Moultrie? The church is always full. I hope you go regularly to church; and from what I have heard of Dr. Peewee, I respect him very highly. 'Why,' said he, 'when we go into church, you know, we all put our heads down in front of the pew, or in our hands, for a little while, and Dr. Maundy spreads his handkerchief on the desk and puts his face into it for quite a long time. he asked, in a really perplexed way, Fanny says. 'Why,' said she, gravely, 'Mr. said he; 'I never thought of that.' 'Why, what do you do, then?' "Your affectionate mother, Abel read the letters, and stood looking at the floor, musingly. "I must go into the houseâ"I will call my grandfather, whom I suppose you wish to see." "Yes, I draw, and am very fond of it," he answered, as he untied his port-folio. now, what is that?" You draw very well, Mr. Newt." "Well, scenes and figures out of books." "Why so?" "Yes, certainly. "No, no," answered Abel, laughing, "that shouldn't be in the book. Good-morning!" "Not at all." "How did you know that I had such a cousin?" "Aunty, did you call me?" "Yes, Hope." asked Mrs. Simcoe at length, still gazing at the distant hills. "He insulted him." It is unkind, Auntyâ"unkind." asked Mrs. Simcoe. "Aunty, Aunty, what do you mean?" "I mean, Hope, that you are in love with Abel Newt." She stepped back a little. "Aunty, is it wrong to love him?" It was Hiram, who announced the victim of yesterday's battle, waiting in the parlor to say a word to Miss Wayne. "Yes, Hiram." "Abel ran against me, and I got very angry and struck him. It was wrong; I know it was, and I am very sorry. It was a bold, dashing sketch. he replied. Oh yes. Good boy, very good boy," said Abel, laughing. In the midst of it all Hiram was heard remonstrating outside: "Don't, Sir, don't! He burst into the room. "Hope, go up stairs!" "Why, Sir," said Abel, "you gave me leave to come here and sketch." Go, both of you! "Go, both of you!" It was impossible to resist; and Abel and Gabriel moved slowly toward the door. Abel turned to the door, and bowed gravely to Hope. It was a secret better buried in their own bosoms. It was an indignity that made Abel tingle whenever he thought of it. They were those of Hope and Mrs. Simcoe. "Carefully, carefully!" They were running toward Gabriel down the main road; but just as he came up with them he flung himself with all his might toward the animals' heads. she said to Hope, when they both knew that the crisis was over, and her lips moved in silent prayer and thanksgiving. In her inmost heart she hoped it was Abel Newt who had saved them. asked she, haughtily. "Where can I see you?" "Where are you going?" "Home." "In a few weeks." "Where is your home?" "In New York." It was very much to the point. whispered Abel. Here, my dear!" he said. was all he caught as Hope Wayne took Mrs. Simcoe's arm and walked away. It was worked into the ground glass of the door that led from his dining-room to the back stairs. It was Mrs. Dagon who sat with Mrs. Newt in her parlor, and said to her, "So your son Abel is coming home. I hope he knows how to waltz, and isn't awkward. Somebody says something about the immense fortune Mr. Shrimp has made in the oil trade. It was warm, and Mrs. Dagon fanned herself. However, people must regard their time of life, and take care of their health. However, I suppose we shall. It was Miss Fanny Newt who spoke, and who had entered the room during the conversation. "Gracious, Fanny, how you do disturb one! "Well, Aunt Dagon, who've you been lunching on?" Aunt Dagon looked a little appalled. she said, fanning herself violently. It was dreadful to hear her say such things, my dear; and then to see the whole room stare at you! It was cruelâ"it was really unfeeling." "Well, let me see; she's about my age, I suppose." "Oh no, dear Aunt, only into their bedsâ"and that not until they are superannuated, which, you know, old people never find out for themselves," answered Fanny, smiling sweetly and calmly upon Mrs. Dagon. "No, noâ"not at all! Good-morning, darling Aunt Dagon!" "How should I know, mother?" You might as well talk of breathing in a vacuum." said she to Mr. Wetherley. "No, I suppose not; eh! "Oh, indeed! No, indeed. "Oh, indeed!â"" he began. "It's the very thing I am trying to do, and you won't let me. Please, please, Miss Newt!" "Mr. Wetherley," interrupted the other, imperiously, "you wish to ask me to marry you. "As you please," said she. said he, wiping his face. said a clear, strange voice. It was a young man, with clustering black hair and sparkling eyes, in a traveling dress. "Mr. Wetherley, this is my brother, Mr. Abel Newt." "Oh, indeed!" said Zephyr. "Chance, chance, Mr. Wetherley. Well, it's all the grandpa's doing. Grandpas are extraordinary beings, Mr. Wetherley. Good-morning, Miss Newt. Good-morning, Sir." "How did you come here, you wretch!" Fanny, you're wonderful." "So you've really come home for good? Well, Abel, I'm glad. said Abel, laughing, sinking into a chair. "Mother wrote me you said that all Boston girls are dowdy. It was upon South Street, and the windows looked out upon the shipping in the East Riverâ"upon the ferry-boats incessantly crossingâ"upon the lofty city of Brooklyn opposite, with its spires. It was dark in that office when Mr. Newt first occupied the rooms, and Thomas Tray, the book-keeper, who had the lightest place, said that the eyes of Venables, the youngest clerk, were giving out. It was scratch, scratch, scratch, all day long in the clerks' office. It was clearly packet-day. Be short. "I want a place, Sir." "What kind of a place?" "In a store, Sir." "I'm sorry I'm all full. "Most ready out there?" asked Mr. Newt. "Most ready, Sir." "Brisk's the word this morning, you know. Please to copy these letters." "Well, Sir, you seem a strong, likely lad. "No, Sir. asked Mr. Lawrence Newt, looking at the lad with a kindly humor in his eyes. "Oh no, Sir," replied the boy, surprised. Now, my boy, think a moment. Honor bright, my boy. If you think there is, say so!" "Well, Sir, I suppose worse things could happen to us than poverty," said he. If you do not begin by considering poverty the root of all evil, where on earth do you expect to end? Cease to be poor, learn to be rich. I am rich, but I am not fortunate." asked Mr. Newt. "Why, yes, Sir. Trueâ"so am I. asked Mr. Newt, abruptly. "Abel is a smart boy," said Mr. Newt. Thomas, ask Venables to step this way." That young man appeared immediately. "Mr. Venables, you are promoted. Be friends. Now go to work." It is a long time since I have had the honor of writing to you; but I thought you would wish to know that Miss Wayne will be in New York, for the first time, within a day or two after you receive this letter. She is with her aunt, Mrs. Dinks, who will stay at Bunker's. It is a great pity that men are not considerate, and all that. Life is a scrub-raceâ"melancholy, Abel, but true. I talk plainly to you, but I do it for your good. If we were all angels, things would be different. But it is notâ"how very sad! True, how very sad! It was in Mr. Boniface Newt's counting-room that he preached this gospel. "Good-morning, Mr. Hadley. "Nothing, nothing," returned the customer. "Pretty print that. If it's the right width, it's just the thing. "No, not wide enough. "Where is the yard-stick?" asked Mr. Hadley. "No." "Good-morning, Mr. Newt; sorry that I see nothing farther," said Mr. Hadley, and he went out. asked he, sharply. demanded the appalled boy. "Why, Sir, because it wasn't the last," said the boy. Mr. Abel Newt, to his father's eyes, had the air of a man of superb leisure; and as he sat reading the paper, with one leg thrown over the arm of the office-chair, and the smoke languidly curling from his lips, Mr. Boniface Newt felt profoundly, but vaguely, uncomfortable, as if he had some slight prescience of a future of indolence for the hope of the house of Newt. Not at all. It's give and take. It's very sad, I know; it's very sad, indeed. Ah, yes! Oh, yes! So 'tis all round. Mr. Abel Newt was not a philosopher; he was a man of action. It is the profound conviction of all who were familiar with that seminary that the pupils would not have shrunk from marrying a crown-prince, or any king in any country who confined himself to Christian wedlock with one wife, or even the son of an English dukeâ"so perfect was the polish, so liberal the education. It was a Summer party, Abel saidâ"mere low-necked muslin, strawberries and ice-cream. asked Mrs. Whetwood Tully, who had recently returned with her daughter, one of Madame de Feuille's finest successes, from a foreign tour. You've not been in England, I believe, Miss Newt?" Dolly, dear!" "Yes, ma." asked Miss Fanny Newt. no, my dear. a Viscount?" a Viscount." "Well, Dolly dear, do you see how much Mr. Abel Newt resembles Lord Tattersalls?" "Yes, ma." "It's very striking, isn't it?" "Yes, ma." "Or now I look, I think he is even more like the Marquis of Crockford. "Yes, ma?" "Yes, ma." You remember the Wellington nose, my child?" "Yes, ma." "Yes, ma." "Yes, dear." "Yes, I'm sure," said Miss Tully. It was necessary to remove any suspicion that she might entertain in consequence. said he, ardently, in a low voice, looking Grace Plumer directly in the eyes. "Yes, it is a pretty song." said Abel. said she. "Yes," said Abel. "No, no," said Abel, "we shall find the tropics in that conservatory." It was his sister. "Abel, I want to present you to Miss Whetwood Tully." Miss Tully, I am sure, is charming. It was prettily illuminated with a few candles, but was left purposely dim. Some one was sitting thereâ"some one did hear. Abel smiled in his heart, and bent more closely to his companion. Some one not only heard, but started. Somebody else started then; for under the great orange-tree, on the cane sofa, sat Lawrence Newt and Hope Wayne. They were sitting at the window upon Broadway watching the promenaders along that famous thoroughfare; for thirty years ago the fashionable walk was between the Park and the Battery, and Bunker's was close to Morris Street, a little above the Bowling Green. That was the way that Lawrence Newt and Hope Wayne came to be sitting on the cane sofa under the great orange-tree in Boniface Newt's conservatory. He spoke of her home with an accuracy of detail that surprised her. It was the vision of a moment; but in the attitude, the tone, the whole impression, Hope Wayne instinctively felt treachery. "Yes, let us go in!" she said to Lawrence Newt, as she rose calmly. It was not swarthy, nor black, nor gloomy. It was an illuminated shadow. said Amy Waring, in a cordial, cheerful voice, with a pleasant smile. Hope bowed, and thanked her. "No; but he seems to have lived every where, to have seen every thing, and to have known every body. said Amy, smiling. Amy smiled, and asked, "Why a pity?" "Yes," replied Amy; "I have no doubt of that. asked Lawrence Newt, who had come up silently, and now stood beside her. "Yes, by what?" It was such a different sweetness from Amy Waring's, that Hope turned and looked very curiously at Miss Fanny. They could not see beyond the words, nor hope to. "Fanny," said he, "I will speak to you in a parable. It was upon a hill, in a grove. The builder held his tongue, dear Fanny. It was insulting to the public, which manifested so profound an interest in the tower, that the immediate neighbor should preserve so strict a silence, and such a perfectly tranquil mind. Tell us, then, all about it! Never, retorted Rusticus. "Yes, Uncle Lawrence." It is a great point gained when we have learned to hoe the potatoes in our own fields, and not vex our souls about our neighbor's towers." The rest gradually followed, until there was a universal departure. Why, this is a dreadful business in Salem! In the mighty stream, of which men and women are the waves, that poured ceaselessly along its channels, friends met surprisedâ"touched each other's hands. In the evening the Park Theatre is jammed to hear Mr. Forrest, who made his first appearance in Philadelphia nine or ten years ago, and is already a New York favorite. Nobody in town, because Mrs. Boniface Newt & Co. have gone to Saratogaâ"no cathedral left, because some plastering has tumbled off an upper stoneâ"no forest left, because a few leaves have whirled away. Nobody in town, because Mrs. Boniface Newt & Co. have gone to Saratoga, and are doing their part of the world's work there. echoed Mr. Dinks. "Where did you come from? "It's stupid there," said Mr. Beacon. "Quite stupid," echoed Mr. Dinks. "Fun," replied the gentlemen. "Well, I'm going about my business," said she. "Good-morning." "Very," said Zephyr. they asked. "Good-morning, Amy," said she, in a hard and dry, but not unkind voice. she asked, with piteous earnestness. "Amy, would you thwart God? said Amy, tenderly and sadly. "But we must pay the penalty, Amy," said the other. said she; and opened the window. If you only knew Lawrence Newtâ"" The older woman raised one thin finger, without lifting the hand from her lap. "Who's there?" asked Aunt Martha, calmly. cried a loud, coarse voice. Why, it's meâ"Joseph!" Quick, quick! No time, no pay!" Joseph." He took the whole, finished and unfinished, and, bundling them up, made for the door. said she, firmly. Pay for it, of course, ma'am! yes, ma'am, pay for it, of course." "At once," said Amy, without moving. "I'll do so, ma'am," said the man, putting down the bundle. Amy pointed to it, and said, "Now go." "It would be no more than I deserve, Amy." That young gentleman was a second cousin of Hope Wayne's, and his mother had never objected to his little visits at Pinewood, when both he and Hope were young, and when the unsophisticated human heart is flexible as melted wax, and receives impressions which only harden with time. The result was that there were rumorsâ""How do such stories start?" asked Mrs. Budlong Dinks of all her friends who were likely to repeat the rumorâ"that it was a family understanding that Mr. Alfred Dinks and his cousin Hope were to make a match. That was enough for Miss Fanny, whose instinct at once assured her that Mrs. Dinks designed Hope Wayne for her son Alfred, in order that the fortune should be retained in the family. He overdid it a little, as we sometimes do in this world. "Yes, how beautiful!" sighed Fanny. They were content to moralize upon sympathy for some time. "Yes, he's a very good sort of fellow." Dinks." "If he has, how happy they must be! asked he, at length. said Dinks. "Well, I can not do that, but I will make a bargain with you. If you will say what sort of girl you would love, I will answer your question." "Oh not at all, thank you, I am very warm. Dinks." "Well, Sir, I am clear enough about it," replied Major Scuppernong. you do," said the Honorable B. Dinks. But it would be so pleasant if he could drive out his cousin Hope, as so many of the other young men do. Not at all. Dinks." It was understood that she was engaged to Mr. Alfred Dinks, her cousin, who was already, or was to be, very rich. It was dance, drive, bowl, ride, walk incessantly. "Yes, they were different men. Listen to this." "Yes, I often feel that in people as well as in poems," replied Arthur, looking at her closely. "Thank you, I am just coming;" and Hope passed into the wood. Puffâ"puffâ"puff. asked she, dawning upon him. "Stop, please, Miss Wayne!" exclaimed Arthur, as he saw that she was going. "Thank you," said she, quietly, and went in. It was still twilight, and Arthur lighted a cigar and sat down to a meditation. The result of it was clear enough. Puffâ"puffâ"puff. "Where did I get that head?" cried he, suddenly bringing his chair down upon its legs with a force that knocked his cigar out of his mouth, "I copied it from a head which Jim Greenidge has, and which he says was one of his school-fellows." "What men want, and women too, is money. I'm sorry for all this. It's sad, you know. It troubles me. Ah, yes! But it isn't the Millennium. It's give one and take two, if you can get it. here he comes. "Good-mornin', Mr. Newt. sez she. Werry well, sez I, I'll go 'long if you'll go too. "Ma's going to Saratogy," remarked Mr. Van Boozenberg. Werry well, sez I, ma, go." "No, I ain't no fear of that," replied the millionaire. yes, I come in to say I done that as you wanted. "No, Sir, I've been at school." Why, you must be twenty years old!" exclaimed Mr. Van Boozenberg, in great surprise. "Well, well, a great pity! Ma, sez I, what on earth should Corlaer go to college for? Werry well, sez I, and so 'twas; and I think I done a good thing by him." "A werry pretty store you have here, Mr. Newt. "Well, you know, ma, sez she, now pa you mustn't sit in draughts. Good-mornin', Mr. Newt, a werry good-mornin', Sir," said the old gentleman, as he stepped out. asked Abel, when Jacob Van Boozenberg had gone. "Well." It was mysterious, I never could quite understand itâ"though, of course, I believe there was some woman in it. "He's rich, isn't he?" asked Abel. "Yes, he's very rich, and that's the curious part of it," answered his father, "and he gives away a great deal of money in what seems to me a very foolish way. Well, I suppose it is hard sometimes with some of those people. Well, it is the funniest, foggiest sort of world. And that's extremely sad, too, you know. Yes, very sad! "Abel, merchants ought not to smoke cigars in their counting-rooms," said his father, in a half-pettish way. "No, I suppose not," replied Abel, lightly; "they ought to smoke other people. "Nothing at all" "Not even her name?" "Well, there's a difference among men, you know, father. asked Mr. Newt. "He covered it up, laughed, and dropped dead." "Gracious!" It was evidently not the busy season in the Dry-goods Commission House of Boniface Newt & Son. Sez I, 'Done.' In the hush of the summer twilight she heard again the rich voice that seemed to that other girl of Pinewood sweeter than the music of the verses, and felt the penetrating glance, that had thrilled the heart of that girl until her red cheek was pale. She clasped her hands before her, and walked gently up and down the room. But it was entirely dark there. Please let me in." It was useless to resist longer. "Is it?" "Yes, of course it is! "He is my cousin, you know," replied Hope. "Why, cousins are such privileged people. said she. of course not. "No," said Hope, "I'll congratulate him." She, in fact, knew no more than when she came in. said she, as she sailed out of the room. In the same twilight Mrs. Dinks and Alfred sat together in her room. It is too hot to be so absurd. Well, in that case it is not so extraordinary. Not more than six at the outside, I hope. Well, I believe I'll take a little nap." "I wish you wouldn't talk in such a puzzling kind of way, mother. Why, you sly dog, do you think you can impose upon me with an air of ignorance because I am so sleepy. Heigh-ho." asked Alfred, bewildered and wretched; "I didn't know it." "Oh, certainly. "Yes'm." "Dear, dear, DEAR boy!" My son, I congratulate you. "Well, mother, I'm going down," said he. Kiss me, Alfred," replied his mother. It was low about the neck, which, except that it was very white, descended like a hard, round beach from the low shrubbery of her back hair to the shore of the dress. It was very low tide; but there was a gentle ripple of laces and ribbons that marked the line of division. "Why, this kissing business." "Stop, Alfred," said Fanny, imperiously. Now, dear, I'll make a little rule. "Well, then, you shall only kiss me when I am in my morning-dress, and one kiss, with hands off, when we say good-night." "It seems to me very little," said Alfred Dinks, discontentedly; "besides, you always look best when you are dressed." "Thank you, love," returned Fanny; "just remember the morning-dress, please, for I shall; and now tell me all about your conversation with your mother." "I didn't think of it." asked Alfred, blankly. I am very much afraid of it." "I'll go and ask her," said Alfred, rising. It is too delicate a question for you to ask." "Oh no, dearâ"no, not at all," said he. It was a very large sum, indeed. Courage, ma chÃ¨re! said she, even more caressingly. "Yes, I will, I promise," answered Alfred. she asked herself, wondering at the long time during which her son's cunning had lain dormant. Good-by, dear Aunty. Good-by. "Your affectionate, HOPE." It was so fresh and glossy that it might have been cut off the day before. Then, with the old harshness stealing into her face again, she rose calmly, carrying the miniature in her hand, and went out of the room, and down the stairs into the library, which was opposite the parlor in which Abel Newt had seen the picture of old Grandpa Burt at the age of ten, holding a hoop and book. It was the likeness of a lovely girl, whose rich, delicate loveliness, full of tender but tremulous character, seemed to be a kind of foreshadowing of Hope Wayne. asked he. "No, not old. Suppose every body could look in through my face and see what I really think of the merchandise I am selling! No, no, we want no tell-tale faces in South Street." But it did not repel her nor beget distrust. The flower is not sullen, it is only secret. asked Lawrence Newt. "To give the heart to God," replied she. "That I have discovered," he said. "Yes, but haven't you the assurance?" asked she, earnestly. "But assurance is a gift," continued she. "Of Peace," replied Mrs. Simcoe. He took it and gazed closely at it. "This is the man who broke another man's heart and murdered a woman." It was not clear whether she were trying to say something to conceal something, or simply to recover her self-command. It was a terrible spectacle, and Lawrence Newt felt as if he must veil his eyes, as if he had no right to look upon this great agony of another. In the twilight that lost loveliness glimmered down into his very heart with appealing pathos. It fell again. stop, if you, are a man!" In the long, warm afternoons, too, when there is no pressure of business, and the heat is overpowering, he sits also alone among those odors, and his mind is busy with all kinds of speculations, and dreams, and hopes. they ask. What Mary B.? remembers mamma, his mother's name was Mary. Mamma, you remember, of course. "Yes, mamma; but who was Aaron Burr?" It was the most lovely greenâ"the softest color you ever saw; it had the brightest eyes, the most sinuous grace; it had a sort of fascination, but it filled you with fear; fortunately, it was harmless. It is as if he were involuntarily asking pardon for some great wrong that he has unconsciously done them. "Yes," replies the father, who sits upon the sofa, with his wife by his sideâ""yes; Mr. Van Boozenberg was very angry to-day about some error he thought he had discovered, and he was quite short with us book-keepers, and spoke rather sharply." I am sure," replied Mr. Bennet, with the nervous smile flitting across his face and apparently breaking out all over him; and there he remained speechless and bowing, while Mr. Newt hastened to seat himself, that every body else might sit down also. which seemed to say, "Oh! She protested, it was vulgar. And he took Amy's hand, and said, "Whose daughter are you?" "My name is Amy Waring." She is gone; my dear young lady, you will forgive me, but your face recalls other years." In her own room, where she opened the new book and read in it for half an hour at a time, but always poring on the same page. It was such a profound work. It was so full of weighty matter. No, no, dears, society doesn't punish men for being naughtyâ"only women. It was presently clear to him that residence under the parental roof was incompatible with the habits of a strictly fashionable man. It was no wonder that the rooms of Abel Newt became a kind of club-room and elegant lounge for the gay gentlemen about town. "I mean, Sir, that you are spending a great deal too much money." "Why, how is that, Sir?" asked his son, as he called to the boy in the outer office to bring him a light. Yes, Sir, ruinous! Abel smoked calmly during this energetic discourse, and blew little rings from his mouth, which he watched with interest as they melted in the air. "Well, now, if by some hocus-pocus the Bank of New York hadn't a cent in coin at this moment, it could redeem the few claims that might be made upon it by borrowing, could it not?" "Abel, what do you mean?" I see no moral at all." "Clearly," answered Mr. Newt. "Yes." "Yes." "No," said Mr. Newt, following his son closely. "Well, then; don't you see?" "No, I don't see," replied the father; "that is, I don't see what you mean." "Why, father, look here! We are crossing the bridge of credit. cried Boniface Newt, springing up, and in so loud a tone that the clerks looked in from the outer office. "By my marriage," returned Abel, quietly. asked Mr. Newt, earnestly. "With an heiress." Mr. Abel did not happen to suggest to his father that, for the purpose of marrying an heiress, if he should ever chance to be so fortunate as to meet one, and, having met her, to become enamored so that he might be justified in wooing her for his wifeâ"that for all these contingencies it was a good thing for a young man to have a regular business connection and apparent employmentâ"and very advantageous, indeed, that that connection should be with a man so well known in commercial and fashionable circles as his father. It was a frequent joke of Abel's with his father, after the recent conversation, that credit was the most creditable thing going. It was well known that she was in town. Why, the man's a donkey!" It was not a "cut," as Abel said to himself; "not at all. It was simply ranking me with the herd." "Who's that stopping to speak with her?" asked Corlaer, as he turned back to see her. It was the first time he had met her since the summer days of Saratoga; and as he stood talking with her upon the sidewalk, and observed that her cheeks had an unusual flush, and her manner a slight excitement, he could not help feeling a secret pleasureâ"feeling, in truth, so deep a delight, as he looked into that lovely face, that he found himself reflecting, as he walked away, how very fortunate it was that he was so entirely devoted to his art. asked Arthur Merlin. But it was impossible. "Have what known, aunt?" said she, in a slow, incredulous tone, and with her eyes sparkling with laughter. asked she. "Oh, Diana! That was the only speech he made, and nobody heard it. It was pure romance, but without any thing technically romantic. "Well, let me see," replied Arthur, cheerfully, and pondering as if to determine who was exactly the man. It was really beautiful to see his exclusive enthusiasm for his art. "No, no," said Lawrence Newt, laughing; "art must get its ideal out of the real. asked Lawrence Newt. "Well, let me see," continued the other, "what do you think of that young Southerner, Sligo Moultrie, who was at Saratoga? said Arthur, conclusively. It was rapt in the intensity of fancy, and Lawrence knew perfectly well that he saw Hope Wayne's Endymion before him. asked he. "Why, of course, how dull I am! Abel will be your Endymion, if you can get him." "No, not personally. "Well, he's a very handsome young man; and though he be dark, he may also be Endymion. She always did. "I want to see every body come in. "Good-evening, dear, good Mrs. Winslow Orry," said the smiling eyes of Mrs. Dagon to that lady. "Yes, she has had some kind of whim," replied Mrs. Dinks, shaking her shoulders as if to settle her dress. retorted Mrs. Dinks, in almost a bellicose manner. "Why, yes, dear Mrs. Dinks; don't you remember at Saratogaâ"you know?" continued Fanny, with imperturbable composure. asked Mrs. Dinks, with smooth defiance on her face, and conscious that she had never actually mentioned any engagement between Alfred and Hope. That was enough. That was the next step. They were speaking of Hope Wayne. They were chatting together pleasantly, Lawrence Newt usually leading, and Hope Wayne bending her beautiful head, and listening and looking at him in a way to make any man eloquent. Which are the best toads, the fattest?" asked Mr. Whitloe. Yes, very good! It's quite confusing, likeâ"sort of bewildering. "Good-evenin', marm. Well, 'tis dreadful hot, Mrs. Newt. I'm all in a muck. I'm all sticky." You rememberâ"hey, ma?" 'Law, pa,' sez she, 'Mrs. sez she. I am very sorry. "But you know what young sons are, Mr. Van Boozenberg.'" "Mercy, yes, Mrs. Newt! And I sez to ma, 'Ma, he do.' Tut, tut! The bills. it's the way with all young men, marm. Oh, 'tain't nothin'. It was almost as perfect as the Paris toys which you wind up, and which spin smoothly round upon the table. Colonel Burr himself, my dears, never dared to touch more than the tips of his partner's fingers in the contra-dance. In the mean while she had been learning every thing at once. It was no more necessary for Mrs. Van Kraut to fan herself than if she had been a marble statue. But it is proper to fan one's self when one has done dancingâ"so she waved the fan. It was studded with jewels. It was part of the property. "Yes," said he, as he saw that he was not overheard, and sinking his voice into that tone of tender music which Hope so well rememberedâ""yes, making every body in the world happy but one person." In the eyes of the old gentleman it was another instance of imprudence on Abel's part not to be already engaged to some rich girl. asked Lawrence Newt, with such a kindly glimmer in his eyes, that Mr. Dinks said merely, "really," and moved on, remarking to General Arcularius Belch, with a diplomatic shrug, that Lawrence Newt was a very odd man. "Odd, but not without the coin. demanded Fanny, her eyes glittering with inquiry. continued Lawrence. "Why, when I saw you talking together a little while ago, I could think of nothing but the young Bonaparte and the old Wurmser." It was an astuter young Napoleon than Uncle Lawrence knew. said he, "have you told mother?" "No," answered she, calmly. "Well, but then you knowâ"" rejoined Alfred. "Well, then, listen, Alfred! If you go home and talk with her and Hope Wayne, you can not help betraying that you are engaged to me; andâ"you know your mother, Alfredâ"she would openly oppose the marriage, and I don't know what she might not say to my father." "It's a great pity, isn't it?" said he, feebly. "We must be married, Alfred, dear!" "To-day," said Fanny, firmly, and putting out her hand to her beloved. "To-day, Fanny?" asked he, after a pause of amazement. continued Fanny, in a most assuring tone, "that if we go to your mother and say, 'Here we are, married!' he inquired, at length, without raising his eyelids. said Alfred, in a state of temporary blindness continued. "Well, Alfred, dear!" said Alfred, in a crisp, resolute tone. "And, John, tell Mary to bring me my things. I am going out." It was perhaps a judicious instinct which taught Fanny not to leave Alfred alone by going up to array herself in her own chamber. Fanny." They were both working busily, and said little to each other. I hear his step," said Mrs. Dinks. Hope bowed, and was passing on. "Stop, Hope!" whispered Alfred, excitedly. "Yes, 'm," replied the new husband. Good-morning, Mrs. Dinks." God speed youâ"and so will I, all I can." And he did so. He took him up in the arms of his charity and moved him round and round. He put him upon his sympathy as upon an easel, and turned on the kindly lights and judiciously darkened the apartment. They were so lovely, so fragrant! But it was a singular fact that when one of those baskets without a card arrived at the house, it was not left in superb solitary state upon the centre-table in the parlor, but bloomed as long as care could coax it in the strict seclusion of Miss Waring's own chamber, and then some choicest flower was selected to be pressed and preserved somewhere in the depths of the bureau. It was a woman with innumerable children, of courseâ"some old nurse of Amy'sâ"who had a kind of respectability to preserve, which intrusion would injure. No, no, by Heaven! It was some old teacher of Amy'sâ"some music-master, some French teacherâ"dying alone and in poverty, or with a large family. About thirty. I am sure he ought to. "He is such a good, noble fellow! "God bless you, Amy dear!" "Yes, thank Heaven! the South is home, Miss Grace. It is a trading town." It was a passive, not an active nature. said he. "Yes, I suppose they are, and a dreadfully lonely time they're having of it. Moultrie?" "Yes, it is lonely in some ways. "Thank you," said Grace, bowing mockingly. "Man includes woman, I believe, Mr. Moultrie." Moreover, she felt at home with him as a compatriot. Yes, this would do very well. It was the face of Abel Newt, who raised his hat and bowed to her with an admiration which he concealed that he took care to show. I recognize the dear, delicious spring. It was audacious. "Moultrie, glad to see you. "What, Mr. Moultrie, two other cases? cried Moultrie, laughing and looking at them. "Good, good, good for Moultrie!" "Very well, Mr. Moultrie. "At home, in Louisiana." yes. "I do them no harm," replied Abel. "No; but you make them jealous." he asked, in pure music. Grace blushed, and laughed. What more could it be, Mr. It was very sweet. He rose from table, and walked up and down the room. said he, petulantly, to his wife. "No; but old Mr. Burt is his grandfather." "I believe so. "No, not much." said he, bitterly; "and now the girl must fall to cutting up shines. But to be poor, too! "Mother, I am sorry for poor Fanny," said she. "Hold your tongue, Miss!" May said no more. I beg your pardon, she is Miss Newt, now that her sister is so happily married," said Boniface Newt, bowing ceremoniously to his daughter. "No, the more's theâ"" He stopped, for he caught May's eye, and he could not finish the sentence. That was the chance, but Mr. Newt was skeptical. asked she. It looks like it, really. "No, Aunt Dagon," said Mr. Newt. And he bowed again to his wife, "Don't, don't," sobbed she. Aunt Dagon, I never knew him so unjust and wicked as he is to-day. "Now, Nancy, tell me about this thing," said Mrs. Dagon, when the husband was gone. She wants an establishment, and she has got it. It's quite right, my dear." In the matter of the marriage Mrs. Budlong Dinks had been defeated, but she was not dismayed. It was useless to wish impossible wishes. "Good-morning, Mrs. "Good-morning, Mrs. asked Mrs. Dagon, abruptly. "Good-morning, my dear Mrs. Dinks," said Mrs. Newt, in a troubled voice, as she entered the room. "Singular, indeed, Mrs. "Yes, indeed, it is an outrage upon all our feelings. "Yes, oh yes!" "I mean that they are neither of them children," answered the other. asked Mrs. Newt, earnestly. asked she. So do I. Theoretically, of course, the man does it. exclaimed she. "I believe the husband usually supports the wife," ejaculated the dragon behind the glasses. "Pity, pity!" I hope Mr. Newt won't suffer himself to be disturbed. "I mean that his mind is so engrossed with other matters that he rarely attends to the domestic details," added Mrs. Dinks, who had no desire of frightening any of her new relatives. "Gracious, gracious! Suppose he should take a whim to stop it? It was the sign for Mrs. Newt to burst into fresh sorrow. "Very well, then, Mrs. Newt," said her visitor, rising, "Mr. Newt will have the satisfaction of seeing his daughter starve." Newt." exclaimed Mrs. Newt. "Good-morning, ladies!" Fathers do so in novels, thought she. The calmness was, indeed, a little unnatural. In the solitude of his studio, as he drew many pictures upon the canvas, and sang, and smoked, and scuffled across the floor to survey his work from a little distanceâ"and studied its progress through his open fistâ"or as he lay sprawling upon his lounge in a cotton velvet Italian coat, inimitably befogged and bebuttonedâ"and puffed profusely, following the intervolving smoke with his eyeâ"his meditations were always the same. He found Hope Wayne always friendly and generous. It was natural she should think it was Arthur who had helped her. "He is certainly a handsome fellow," said Amy Waring. asked Arthur. said she. "Why, that gives what you call social success." I mean that I don't wonder such a handsome, bright, graceful; accomplished young man, who lives in fine style, drives pretty horses, and knows every body, should be a great favorite with the girls and their mothers. said he. "No, for he has sense enough to conceal the coxcomb. "I didn't know you knew him," replied Amy, looking up. "No, no," said he, hastily; "I don't know him, I believe; but I know about him." "I mean," said Arthur, quite confused, "that I don'tâ"somehowâ"that is to say, you know, there's a sort of impression you get about peopleâ"" Lawrence Newt interposedâ" "I suppose that Arthur doesn't like Abel for the same reason that oil doesn't like water; for the same reason that you, Miss Amy, and Miss Wayne, would probably not like such a man." "What kind of man is Mr. asked Arthur, abruptly and keenly. "Yes," replied Hope, as she worked on, only a little more rapidly. "Well, what kind of man do you think him to be?" continued Arthur, nervously. Nobody spoke. asked Lawrence. Try to control your nerves, and rely upon Providence." Abel smiled and bowed on each side of him, filled his own glass and lighted a cigar. "Beautiful! Yes, by Heaven! So is our host, Sir. asked Captain Lamb of Abel, while the knife waited and rested a moment on the outside of the mouth. "I believe he is, Sir," said Abel, at a venture. yes," replied Abel. It was to give the cue to the company of changing their places, so that he might sit where he would. "I mean that men of my years usually feed with younger and softer people than I see around me here," explained the young man. "Yes, of course, I understand," replied Mr. Dinks, loftily, who had not the least idea what Abel meant; "young men must expect to begin at women's dinners." I beg pardon, your son Alfred and my sister Fanny." "Yes," returned the Honorable Mr. Dinks, "I don't go to women's dinners." Abel smiled to himself. Dinks." Sir. However, Sir, as that is his affair, and as I do not find it very interestingâ"no offense, Sir, for I shall always be happy to see my daughter-in-lawâ"we had better, perhaps, find some other topic. I regard him as an honor to your State, Sir." Mr. Abel Newt bowed to Mr. Dinks as he spoke, while that gentleman listened with the stately gravity with which a President of the United States hears the Latin oration in which he is made a Doctor of Laws. "Now, Sir," persisted Abel, "I will not conceal from youâ"for I know a father's heart will wish to know to what his son is exposedâ"that my father is in quite a frenzy about this affair." I hope he has not. "With all my heart," said Abel. cried he. It was only to remember that the wary old man had shut down the portcullis of the bank vaults, and that loans were getting to be almost impossible. It was summer again, and Aunt Martha sat sewing in the hardest of wooden chairs, erect, motionless. "Amy, Lawrence Newt has been here." "No, Amy, I know you did not tell him," said Aunt Martha. I cried, 'Who's there?' 'A friend,' was the reply. My knees trembled, Amy. 'I am ready,' I answered. said Amy, after a few moments, and her hand had taken Aunt Martha's, but she let it go again when she saw that it helped her to tell the story if she worked. said Amy again, after another pause. Miss Amy looked as indifferent as she could, knowing that her companion was studying her face. said she, in a low voice. They were still silent, when there was a knock at the door. said she. "Amy, dear, you can not understand. Please God, I shall walk in it." It was clear that her idea of obedience to God was to do precisely what she was doing. "I will not quarrel with what you say, but I want you to grant me a request." "I will," said she. "Well, now please, I want you to go next Sunday and hear a man preach whom I am very fond of hearing, and who has been of the greatest service to me." "Always." "Yes, he is a wonderful youth. she asked. exclaimed she, raising both hands with the energy of her words. Amy said she hoped so too, and walked quietly by his side. "I didn't say why I was going out of town. Yet I ought to tell you," said he. "See, here is the note which I received this morning." Come, if you can. asked Lawrence, shooting entirely away from the subject. "No, I mean sometimes even when they do love each other," said the resolute Amy. "I mean," said Amy, as if answering his thoughts, "that there may sometimes be reasons why even lovers should not marryâ"reasons which every noble man and woman understand; and therefore I do not agree with you that it is always a pity for a girl not to be married." Miss Amy, will you go too?" he said, with an air of surprise and sadness, and with a voice trembling with tenderness and respect. It was so natural to think so. he said to himself. Come, Newt! Come, Newt! It was not often that the painter went to church. Then, moving like a shadow to the desk, the preacher, in a voice that was in singular harmony with the expression of his face, began to read a hymn. His voice had a remarkable cadence, rising and falling with yearning tenderness and sober pathos. It was full of reverence, gratitude, longing, and resignation: "While Thee I seek, protecting Power, Â Â Be my vain wishes stilled; And may this consecrated hour Â Â With better hopes be filled." It was taken up by the congregation until the church trembled with the sound, and the saunterers in the street outside involuntarily ceased laughing and talking, and, touched by some indefinable association, raised their hats and stood bareheaded in the sunlight, while the solemn music filled the air. He began in the same calm, simple way. It was a Father whose message the preacher brought. Oh, give them rest!" It is the eternal spring of living water. It is your life, and it flows for you. Then, woe! It is a ravening wolf, and ere morning you are consumed. It is a broken reed, and your fall will be forever fatal. Woe, woe! Woe, woe! Woe, woe! Woe, woe! Some fainted, but could not be borne out, so solid was the throng. For all of us, rest. For you who, just awakened, tremble in doubt, rest. For you, young woman, who despairest of heaven, rest. For you, young man, so long in the bondage of sin, rest. In the large drawing-room, draped in cool-colored chintz, where once Gabriel Bennet and Abel Newt had seen Hope Wayne, on the table where books had lain like porcelain ornaments, lay a strange piece of furniture, long, and spreading at one end, smelling of new varnish, studded with high silver-headed nails, and with a lid. It was lined with satin. Yes, it was a casket. It was sixty-four years before that the portrait was painted, and if one had come searching for that boy he would have found himâ"by lifting that lid he would have seen him; but in those sunken features, that white hair, that startling stillness of repose, would he have recognized the boy of the soft eyes and the tender heart, whose June clover had not yet blossomed? They were family carriages, and stopped at the front door, which was swung wide open. They were mostly clad in sober colors, and said nothing, or conversed in a low, murmuring tone, or in whispers. And he prayed a long prayer. He spoke of the good works of this life, and the sweet promises of the next; of the Christian hero, who fights the good fight encompassed by a crowd of witnesses; of those who do justice and love mercy, and walk in the way of the Lord. His voice ceased, and silence fell again upon the house. They rolled it into a hearse that stood upon the gravel, and the man who closed the lid buttoned a black curtain over the casket. He took out his glasses and placed them upon his nose, and slowly surveyed the company. "Second. "Fourth. It was a strange spectacle. It was in the way of business. Nobody else cared to approach her; but he went over to her presently. "Well, Fanny." "Well, Uncle Lawrence." "Beautiful place, Fanny." "Is it?" "I'm sorry for you, Fanny." "I mean that an old fox is a sly fox," said she, with the hissing sneer. "I mean that sly old foxes who have lined their own nests can afford to pity a young one who gets a silver shoe-buckle," hissed Fanny, with bitter malignity. In her whole bearing and aspect there was that purity and kindliness which are always associated with blue eyes and golden hair, and which made the painters paint the angels as fair women. "We were talking about the future life of the mistress of this mansion," said Hope Wayne to Lawrence as he joined them. asked he; "that is always the first question." asked he. We could do it, aunty and I." "Where will you go?" asked Lawrence. yes. h'm ha, yes, oh yesâ"congratulate you." Nobody was left behind but the trustees and the family and Lawrence Newtâ"the Dinks were of the family. It was only a murmur mingling with the whisper of the pine-trees. It was even a little sallow in hue and satiated in expression. It was not Herbert Octoyne, nor Corlaer Van Boozenberg, nor Bowdoin Beacon, nor Sligo Moultrie, nor any other of his set, who especially remarked his expression; it was, oddly enough, Miss Grace Plumer, of New Orleans. Pictures also. "Yes. It is the Sistine, you know," says the Prince, as he sees that the waiter pours wine for Mrs. Plumer. It is a character which always interests herâ"which half fascinates her. The books are good, but not too good. She is a Creole, with the Tropics in her hair and complexion, and Spain in her eyes. He asks pardon, and it is repeated. If so, she does not choose to betray it. It is the tone and not the words which are eloquent. "I did not speak of the bird; I spoke of the cage," are the words that Miss Plumer next hears, and from the other side. "Even a cage may be a home, I suppose." "Ask the canary." Moultrie." "Miss Grace?" "Well, Mr. Newt." "Yes." "Yes." "Yes." "Miss Grace, do you remember what I said once of honest admirationâ"that if it were eloquent it would be irresistible?" "Well, Miss Plumer, it seems to me the serene sweetness of that picture is the expression of the perfect happiness of entire admirationâ"that is to say, of love; whoever loves is like those cherubsâ"perfectly happy." She is still looking at the Prince, when Mr. Moultrie begins again: "I ought to be allowed to explain that I only meant that as a cage is a home, so it is often used as a snare. By-the-by, how lovely Laura Magot is this evening!" "What kind of birds, Mr. Moultrie?" she says, at length. "Miss Grace, do you know the story of the old Prince of Este?" answers he, as he lays a bunch of grapes upon her plate. He takes it and puts it in his mouth. "Well." "Well, Miss Grace, she was so beautiful that many a lady became her friend, and many of those friends sighed for the brother's fiery eyes and blushed as they heard his honeyed tongue. "No, Miss Plumer, only of Alcibiades. It was a pretty cage, I think; the sister was a lovely bird. "Very well! "Why, then, she had a very pleasant visit," he says, gayly. "Mr. Moultrie, is that the whole of the story?" "I want to hear the rest." "Very well. "Not at all. "No, Miss Grace, you didn't." Moultrie?" "I mean the Princess remained." "So you said. "No." "Well." I mean nothing new." Moultrie." She is a woman, and she knows why. "But you had the advantage of every body else." "Why, you were at school in Delafield until you were no chicken." "Well, didn't you know what a stunning heiress she was, and so handsome! "Why so, Mr. It is already late, and there is no disposition to be seated. It is the very moment he had intended to be standing by her side, to hold her arm in his, and to make her feel that the music which pealed in long cadences through the midnight, and streamed through the draped windows into the room, was the passionate entreaty of his heart, the irresistible pathos of the love he bore her. It recedes slowly, slowly up the street. "Permit me, Miss Plumer," says Sligo. "Allow me, Miss Grace," says Abel. "Thank you for a delightful evening, Mr. Newt. I like it all very well. Go on, my dear. However, it's all one, I supposeâ"Grace or Hope are equally pleasant. Not at all inclined to sleep, he goes into his bedroom and finds a cigar. Somebody has got to do it. Young woman, Moultrie was right, and you are wrong. I'll pay now, and you'll pay by-and-by. Yes, my dear Grace, you'll pay by-and-by." "I've got to pay now, and you shall pay by-and-by. Nobody is sleeping there. The bank is quite ready to stay open for such a run of luck in its favor. It is the Prince of the feast, who had told Grace Plumer that he was perfectly happy. said he, gayly, "it would be too much for me hope to make any ladies, and especially young ladies, perfectly happy." And he returned Miss Plumer's look with a keen glance masked in merriment. said Abel, with a laugh, as he pointed at Miss Plumer's companion. They all laughed, but not very heartily. said Abel to himself, with a flash of the black eyes that was startling. Moultrie sat persistently, and so did Abel. It was fairly toward midnight when Abel rose to leave, and at the same moment Sligo Moultrie rose also. "No, thank you; not at all!" "Yes." "Now, Sir; what is it?" "Abel, you are not a fool. asked Abel, half-sneeringly, the smoke rising from his mouth. "I am like other young men," continued Abel. "I am fond of living well, of a good horse, of a pretty woman. I drink my glass, and I am not afraid of a card. "Not that I know," said the other. "Please, Uncle Lawrence, what do you mean, then?" "I mean the way, the spirit in which you do things. If you are not conscious of it, how can I make you? "Yes, if you choose, as a handwriting on the wall. "From these husks, Sir?" asked Abel, as he looked around his luxurious rooms, his eye falling last upon the French print of Lucille, fresh from the bath. Abel smiled, but did not answer. Nobody dared to derange the papers or books upon the tables, to move the chairs, or to touch any thing. Or fine fruit for Miss May Newt, with the same message. It was certainly very kind in Uncle Lawrence. It was not strange that Uncle Lawrence had sent him. "Dâ"â" Sinker!" Mr. Abel Newt threw his leg over the arm of the chair and looked at his boot. "He says so," returned Abel, shortly. Abel jumped upâ"his eyes black, his face red. He took his hat and went to the door, saying, "I shall go and conclude the arrangement!" "I believe I am one of the firm," said Abel, coldly. We shall all be beggars in a month. We are ruined. All my sacrifices, my industry, my efforts, are of no use. But it was no new thing. "Miss Grace," said Abel, in a low voice. "Yes," said Miss Plumer, calmly, "I believe it was perfect love. "Mr. Newt." He too had risen, and tried to take her hand. She stepped back. "Stop, Sir, stop!" I am engaged." Abel turned pale. You knew that I loved you, and you allowed me to come. "Grace, Grace, say that you love me!" "Oh, Sligo!" cried Grace, as he put his arm around her. "Pardon me, Miss Plumer. It was a most sinister felicitation. They were the blossoms she had laid away at various timesâ"gifts of Lawrence Newt, or consecrated by his touch. Oh, Father! "Well, Aunt Martha," said she, several months after the death of old Christopher Burt, "I really think you are coming back to this world again." "Amy," she said at length, "God leads his erring children through the dark valley, but he does lead themâ"he does not leave them. Amy only looked, she did not ask who. "How, aunty?" Amy did not speak. It was not because she was unwilling to confide entirely in Aunt Martha, but there was something she did not wish to say to herself. "No," was the low, firm whisper of reply. As their eyes met, he smiled and waved his hand. Alarmed at his coming, doubtful of Aunt Martha's intention, Amy Waring suddenly cried, "Oh! It was an authority natural to such intimate knowledge of the relation of the two persons. And taking her hand, he bent over it and kissed it. "I must go now. Good-by! demanded Arthur, in a resolute and defiant tone, as if he were fully prepared to deny every thing he was about to hear. "Well, my poor boy, the hotter you get the surer I am. "Oh, Arthur, Arthur! It was a remark so totally unexpected that Arthur stopped short and turned quite round. "I mean," said she, holding up the study as if to overwhelm him with resistless proof, "I mean, Arthurâ"and I could cry as I say itâ"that you are a Roman Catholic!" It is the Holy Virgin!" Arthur," she groaned. sighed she. echoed his aunt, as if she were losing her mind. I beg your pardon. Yes, yes. "Well; but Arthur, did she marry him after all?" Bless you, no, Aunt Winnifred. "He is usually very thoughtful," whispered Ellen, as she netted busily. added Gabriel. "He is," she answered, scarcely audibly. "Yes, mother; and I am glad of it. remarked Mr. Bennet, at length. "Yes, mother." "No, mother." "Yes, mother." "No, mother." It was a kind of reading of which he was especially fond, and to which the rest were always willing and glad to listen. It was evidently Edward. "Good-evening, Little Malacca!" cried Gabriel, gayly, as he rose and put out his hand. "Good-evening, Gabriel!" he answered, in a soft, ringing voice; then bowed and spoke to Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. "Where did you first know Mr. Lawrence Newt?" asked Mrs. Bennet. It was at Delmonico's; and a carriage arrived at the Bennets' just in time to convey them. It was really but a moment, yet, as he looked, he lay in a heavily-testered bedâ"he heard the beating of the sea upon the shoreâ"he saw the sage Mentor, the ghostly Calypso putting aside the curtainâ"for a moment he was once more the little school-boy, bruised and ill at Pinewood; but this faceâ"no longer a girl's faceâ"no longer anxious, but sweet, serene, and tenderâ"was this the half-haughty face he had seen and worshipped in the old village churchâ"the face whose eyes of sympathy, but not of love, had filled his heart with such exquisite pain? "He is as black as Abel Newt," said Gabriel, looking with his clear eyes at Hope Wayne. "Oh, yes, I remember now!" However far away it may have seemed, it was apparently a remembrance that roused no especial emotion in Miss Hope Wayne's heart. It was he who negotiated for her house. It was he who daily called and gave her a thousand counsels in the details of management, of which every woman who comes into a large property has such constant need. I do not say that merchants are worse than other people; I only say that their temptations are as great, and that an honest manâ"a man perfectly honest every how and every whereâ"is a wonder. He found himself curiously out of spirits. Very, indeed! It was but a few days after the dinner that the junior partner was taking the old path that led under the tower of the fairy princess, when lo! he met her in the way. In her eyes there was that sweet light of expectation and happiness which illuminated all Gabriel's thoughts of her, and persuaded him that he was the happiest and unworthiest of men. "Where are you going, May?" said May, with unusual ardor. "And his voiceâ"" "Now, Mayâ"" "Well, Sir." "Pleaseâ"" What merry light in the fairy eyes! "Yes," said May, gravely. It was dark and formal. said she, addressing Gabriel. asked Mrs. Alfred Dinks, audibly, of May. Jest you be quiet, sez I, ma, it's comin'. So 'twas. I know'd all about it." His own, however, went up at a more precipitate angle and rested with the feet apart upon the mantle. It was evident, however, that many of his friends had not been so successful, for the grate, the hearth, and the neighboring floor were spotted with the fluid. It is a great pity. "Yours, PERIWING & BUDDBY." However, it's a great while since he has done any thing for the party.â"By Jove!" He took a fresh quid in his mouth, and, putting his hands upon his knees, sat silently for five minutes, and then said, "I have the man!" If we only have men who see from our point of view, we are sure of it. asked Mr. Ele. "He isn't," returned General Belch. "No." "I do. our country's what, Mr. "Dâ"â" it! Our country's what, Mr. "They do," said Mr. Ele, taking snuff. "Well, now, don't you see what kind of man Abel Newt is?" I am very sorry for Watkins Bodley. certainly." Good-morning, Mr. Eleâ"good-morning, my dear Sir." His port-folio lay before him upon the desk, open. In the outer office the book-keeper was still at work. The rest of the year he was in the office by nine in the morning, and did not leave before six at night. "I want Mr. Newt." "He is not here." "Where is he?" It was very short and simple, as Abel found when he read it: "MY DEAR SIR,â"I have just heard of your misfortunes. In the shindy of life every body must have his head broken two or three times, and in our country 'tis a man's duty to fall on his feet. "Well, well! Aunt Dagon, it's dreadful to see him. And, oh dear!" she said, giving way to a sudden burst of grief, "he doesn't scold at any thing." "Nothing," replied Mrs. Newt. We shall sell this house, and go and live in a small way out of sight." Why, May, you know nothing about these things. It isn't exactly a pleasant thing, but it's extremely respectable. asked May. "Why, that business is a kind of game, and that every body runs for luck. Oh, I know all about it, my dear! B trusts A, C trusts B, D trusts C, and so on. Colonel Burr used to say that his rule was to keep himself just out of reach of any other block. That was Colonel Burr's principle. Why, such a thing as this is a godsend to 'em. Oh, they will be so sorry!" "Oh, it's dreadful!" So, good-morning! And, May, I want to speak to you." asked Mrs. Dagon, as she closed the door. asked May, with an air and tone of such utter amazement and incredulity that Aunt Dagon immediately recovered from her abstraction, and half smiled. "Why, why not?" said she, with equal simplicity. "Well, May, at any rate I congratulate Gabriel Bennet." It was evidently the only thing for him, whatever it may be for other people. "Well, they are people who were wise early. 'Yes, I do,' said she. 'Well, I don't like it, and I don't want you to waltz.' She pouted and cried, and called him a tyrant. 'I will waltz,' said she at length. 'Very well, my dear,' he answered. If you waltz, I'll get drunk.' I hope you'll be as wise with Gabriel, my dear." "No, darling, I won't go if you say not." How do, Aunt Dagon?" asked May, with the old expression sliding into her eyes that used to be there when she sat aloneâ"a fairy princess in her tower, and thought of many things. asked Mrs. Dagon, sharply. "I mean I'd just as lieve say it before her." "Then say it," said May. "Well, May, darling, couldn't you now just coax Gabrielâ"good fellow, Gabrielâ"used to know him and love him at schoolâ"couldn't you coax him to get Uncle Lawrence to do something?" Dâ"â"n it, that's gone to smash. I mean for myself. May, for your poor brother Abel. You might just try." she asked, indignantly. "Dâ"â"d old hunks!" he shouted. If he expects me to serve him, he must serve me. he said, vacantly, with heavy eyes, "thenâ"thenâ"oh yes!" she asked. he replied. They went on to talk of many things. In all she showed the same calm candor and tenderness. In all he showed the same humorous quaintness and good sense. It was not removed by the conviction which Amy Waring and Arthur Merlin entertained, that at all such times Hope Wayne was trying not to show that she was peculiarly excited by this consciousness. Mrs. Toxer also knitted, and scratched, and counted. It is triumphant. Endymion is a trifle too old, perhaps. "No, no," said Lawrence, gently, "dead; utterly deadâ"to her. "Stop, stop!" "Why so?" "Good-morning, Miss Hope." "Good-morning, Mr. Merlin." said she. "Very busy." "Now." "Now you shall judge," said he. asked Arthur. she asked. Never fear, he will wake up. she asked, as she rose, still looking at the picture. I'm going, and I leave it with you as a legacy. "Good-morning, Mr. Merlin," she said. said he, "did she understand or not?" "By reputation," replied Abel. "He is a very quiet man, but very shrewd. You'll come?" It was not pleasant for young Wetherley, and his friends in a similar situation, to sit down to a night at cards with such a desperate player as Abel Newt. The furniture was worn out, and not replaced. It was unanimously decreed that Abel Newt had lost tone. In the evening, at General Belch's, Abel was presented to all the guests. They went into the dining-room and sat down to what Mr. Slugby called "a Champagne supper." Bat, I am very happy. Sit here, Sir. Bat." Suppose we talk it over." Here Mr. "Mr. Mr. Our principles are all true, and our measures are all just. Mr. Bat, and apprehensively at the new-comer. asked Mr. William Condor, smiling. "I answer for him," replied Mr. Ele. "None at all," replied Abel. "Very," said the others, smoking. It was past midnight, and the gentlemen rose. And he backed the Honorable B. Jawley Ele out of the room into the hall. "This is your coat, I think," said he, taking up a garment and helping Mr. Ele to get it on. "Ah, you luxurious dog! he added, helping his guest toward the door. "Hallo, Condor!" he shouted up the street. He put him put of the door. Oh, you cunning dog! said Abel, laughing, as the General returned, "I wouldn't treat a dog as you do that man." "Yes, but I'm not elected yet, thank you." asked Abel. "Not that I am aware of," said Abel. However, there's one thing. "Not since school," replied Abel. "Well, you know the cue. "Not at all," said General Belch. By-the-by, don't forget that you're a party man of another sort. It isn't much understood yet; but it is a great idea." asked Abel, suddenly. "I make more by staying out." continued Abel. "We were speaking of your speech," said he. "Now, Newt, the thing's in your own hands. You've a future before you. "Too many rivals," said Abel, curtly. said Abel. They were large, coarse-featured, hulking men, and were all named Jim, or Tom, or Ned. "What'll you have, Jim?" "Well, Sir, it's so early in the day, that I can't go any thing stronger than brandy." "Well, Sir, what's the word? "Yes, Jim. "Who's the man, Mr. asked Jim, as if to bring matters to a point. Jim cocked his eye at his glass, which was nearly empty. "The same." "Well, I s'pose it's all right," said Jim, as he began his second tumbler. By-the-by, I've never paid you that ten dollars." "Well, the fellows work well, and deserve it. It was thought that perhaps Mr. Musher and I had better go to the Convention. "Very well, Sir, all right," said Jim. You'll want thirty men to make every thing short and sure. Good-by, Jim, and if any thing goes wrong let me know." They were headed with the inspiring words "Liberty and Equality," with cuts of symbolic temples and ships and lifted arms with hammers, and summoned the legal voters to assemble in primary meetings and elect delegates to a convention to nominate a representative. It was carried with acclamation. I like fish," said Mr. Gray. yes, Sir." Your brother Gyles used to," asked Mr. Gray. up, up, up!" said he, good-naturedly. Mrs. Gray, fish on Fridays." "Mr. Gray," said Mark Blanding. "Well, Mark?" "Mark, I am ashamed of you. "Well, it is Abel Newt, who used to sit at this very table. He spoke so earnestly that his wife involuntarily started. They were alone in the little parlor, with only the portrait on the wall for company, and only the roses in the glass upon the table, that were never wanting, and always showed a certain elegance of taste in arrangement and care which made the daughter of the house seem to be present though she might be away. he said, after another interval of silence, and as if there were a change in the pleasant dreams he was dreaming. "Yes," she replied, and looked at him and smiled, and, smiling, sewed on. "Where is Ellen to-night?" he asked, after a little pause. he inquired, with a smile. asked he, still shaking the slippered foot. "No, with May." For your sake I wanted to be rich." He spoke with a stronger, fuller voice. As he finished, she said, gently, "I am not such a saint, Gerald." "No, I will prove it to you." "I defy you," said Gerald, smiling. "Listen! asked his wife. asked his wife. He lingered, and smiled. Listen again, Sir. "Hush, Sir! "Hush, Sir! asked her husband. "Bothâ"both, Sir. retorted her husband. "No, no; but because it was not an unmixed pity." The restless glance, the glimmering uncertainty, had faded from his eyes. It was full and murmurous. They were going down the street, and saw lights, and heard music and a crowd approaching. It was surrounded by a swarm of men and boys, in the street and on the sidewalk, who shouted, and sang, and ran; and it was followed by a file of gentlemen, marching in pairs. asked Mrs. Bennet. "This is a political procession, my dear. "Why, Slugby, where the devil is he?" said one of them to another, in a whisper, as they ran up the stairs. "Dâ"â"n it! stand up, can't you?" cried Mr. Ele. "No, I can't," replied Abel, with a half-humorous maudlin smile. demanded General Belch, angrily. Nobody answered. "Come now, heave to, every body, and stick him on his pins." And he leered and laughed. They were all holding him and looking very angry, while they heard the loud and imperativeâ""Newt! In the midst of it all the form of the drunken man slipped back upon the sofa, and sitting there leaning on his hands, which rested on his knees, and with his head heavily hanging forward, he lifted his forehead, and, seeing the utterly discomfited group standing perplexed before him, he said, with a foolish smile, "Let's all sit down." "Now," cried he to the others, "open the blinds, and we'll make an end of it." all together." Now we have him. "Dâ"â" Belch," cried the sharp voice. cried Belch, in a piercing voice. Down, down! Silence," in the crowd. asked his wife. "I didn't know it. "No, you dear soul! It was quite late in the evening, and when they entered the parlor there were several persons sitting there. exclaimed Gabriel, who was sitting in a remote dim corner, and who instantly came forward, with May Newt following him. I am happy to see you." "Yes," returned Mrs. Nancy Newt, rapidly; "and now that we are to be so very nearly related, it is really high time that we became intimate." "Yes. Nobody spoke. he said, beating with the bony fingers. "Boniface, you did your best. We all did what we thought best and right." "Let her say what she chooses, Nancy. It was useless for Lawrence to argue. It was the first time they had entered her father's house since her marriage. exclaimed Fanny, involuntarily, and terrified. The calm, hard eyes looked into hers. he said, leaning against the door-frame and nodding his head. he cried, in a threatening tone. he said again, looking at Lawrence Newt, and then in a sneering tone: "Oh! he shouted, with drunken energy, and struggling to free his arms. "Oh, dear me! she sobbed. "Please don't, say any thing about it. and sang on. If you would just try to be a little better man, and go to hear Dr. Maundy preach, say once a year," said Mrs. Dagon, sarcastically, "you would learn that it isn't good works that are the necessary thing." Hope bowed, and made no reply. asked she. "She wishes it." he asked at length, in a troubled voice. His voice trembled as he spoke. They were silent again. asked Lawrence. "I will tell her the story." he inquired. It is the only way. she said. certainly, my dear Belch; say two," replied Abel, with the utmost suavity, as he sat at table with General Belch. "True," replied the other; "very true. "The Public, then, is an ass and a sheep?" "Yes," said the General, "an ass in capacity, and in preference of a thistle diet; a sheep in gregarious and stupid following. "An ass, a sheep, and a cow," said Abel. asked Abel, amused. "No, no," said he, "your illustration is at fault. "No, no," resumed the General, "never forget that the great thing is drillâ"discipline. "Until somebody knocks off your hand," said Abel. "Yes, of courseâ"of course; but that is the very point. You'll do. By-the-byâ"" "Well, what is it?" "Thank you. "Upon conditions," added the General. asked Abel, surprised. "I mean understandings," said the General. certainly," answered Abel. "Give me your hand, Newt. Good-by. Then, moving upon tip-toe, he drew a key from his pocket and fitted it into the lid of a secretary. Tick, tickâ"tick, tick. Tick, tickâ"tick, tick. Tick, tickâ"tick, tick. It was a note of his late firm indorsed by Lawrence Newt & Co. The result was a resemblance, but nothing more. "No, by God!" he shouted, springing up, and clenching his hands. In the wild tumult that overwhelmed his brain as if he were sinking in gurgling whirlpoolsâ"the peaceful lawn of Pinewoodâ"the fight with Gabrielâ"the running horsesâ"the "Farewell forever, Miss Wayne"â"the shifting chances of his subsequent lifeâ"Grace Plumer blazing with diamondsâ"the figure of his father drumming with white fingers upon his office-deskâ"Lawrence and Gabriel pushing him outâ"they all swept before his consciousness in the moment during which he threw out his hands wildly, clutched at the air, and plunged headlong upon the floor, senseless. I pitied him, but what could I do? "Well, dear," said Mrs. Simcoe, after pausing for a few moments, "I can not repeat every detail. "A long, long time. I asked. 'So help me God!' he answered, and left me. 'So help me God!' 'So help me God! 'So help me God!' he whispered, and left me. "He did not come back. I could not cry; I could not smile. I could do nothing but help her silently in the long, hard work, day after day, summer and winter. I started up. 'So help me God!' he said, and did not come. We could not cheer her. "'Mrs. Simcoe, Colonel Wayne.' "Our eyes met. It was my lover. His voice had the same secret music, and his movement that careless grace which seemed to spring from the consciousness of power. It was from her lover. she said, after she had told me every thing. "'But you are two such children,' I said. I do not say that I did just what I should have done, but I helped them. I was to accompany her, and she was to be married. It was a June night; the moon was full. "'Go, Sir!' he shrieked at the young man. "'If your daughter commands it,' he replied. "'You, Mrs. Simcoe? Why, you have lost your wits. "'I am sure I do not know.' Colonel Wayne looked white, but resolute. 'So help me God, I loved him, and he loved me.' 'Go to your room.' "I obeyed, for my duty was done." Simcoe, your story seems to be true. We all do. I am very sorry. Good-day, Mrs. Simcoe. It was already midnight, and the two women sat before the fire. It was the moment when Abel Newt was stealing through his rooms, fastening doors and windows. That was the easiest course. But, Hope, the way of duty is not often the easiest way. "So I staid. It was partly pity for your mother, who began to droop at once. It was partly that I might keep my wound bleeding for my soul's salvation; and partlyâ"I see it now, but I could not thenâ"because I believed, as before God I do now believe, that in his secret heart I was the woman your father loved, and I could not give him up. I told him every thing about your mother, but there was not much to tell. oh, give them rest!' His life was irregular. "Yes," replied Hope, in the same low, appalled tone, "my father went out upon the pond, one evening, with a friend to bathe, and was drowned. It was past midnight. It was the very moment when Abel Newt was starting with horror as he saw his own reflection in the glass. "Aunty, the young man?" "Was Lawrence Newt," answered Mrs. Simcoe. he said, eloquently, in conclusion, "if there is one thing nobler than another, it is an upright, downright, disinterested, honest man. They were given with ardor; and then General Belch was called out for a few remarks, "which he delivered," said the Evening Banner of the Union, "with his accustomed humor, keeping the audience in a roar of laughter, and sending every body happy to bed." "Yes, I told him we should be round after the meeting," replied Mr. Condor; and the party were presently at his rooms. Abel turned his head. "Oh, immensely!" "Yes," returned Abel. asked he. "Hit, by Gâ"â"!" cried General Belch, thumping the table. His tone was threatening, and nobody laughed. asked Abel. "Nor care," said General Belch. "No offense," resumed Abel. His voice thickened rapidly. Abel added, with a fierce hiss. Condor, let me fill your glass. asked Condor. "Well, I heard Jim say t'other day that Mr. William Condor was getting too dâ"â"d stuck up, and that he'd yank him out of his office if he didn't mind his eye. "Well, well," said Belch, impatiently; "we've other business on hand now." However, we'll see. They rose as he spoke. They went down stairs laughing and chatting; and the Honorable Abel Newt, the worthy exemplar of the purest republican virtuesâ"as the resolution stated when it appeared in the next morning's papersâ"was left snoring amidst his constituency of empty decanters and drained glasses. asked Lawrence Newt, cheerfully. "Why, Arthur, what is it?" Never fear, he will wake up. "Dead." "I am older than you, Arthur, and I am your friend. "Yes," said Arthur, "so did I." It was not to be. "I believe she does now," was the slow answer. They were all aware that the head of the house was engaged in some deeply interesting conversation, and they learned from Little Malacca who the stranger was. "Why, what?" asked Arthur, quickly. He spoke in a very low, serious tone. asked Arthur, his face burning with a bright crimson flush. he said. In all of them, too, there was a separation between them. It was a statue only, and forever. "Oh, what a pretty snow-storm!" In the place of Diana there was a full summer moon shining calmly in a cloudless heaven. she asked, observing that Abel merely stared at her stupidly. "Stop, Sir," she said, as soon as she could command herself. "Listen." He spoke with stern command. What it might be, what it ought to be, she had not conceived. he asked, under his breath. "What you knew it would be," she answered. he said, in a half-threatening tone. she asked, pale and calm. "Yes, I have done for this time," he hissed; "but I shall cross you many a time. "God bless you, Amy!" "Why, what do you know about it?" asked Amy. "No; but no eyes could see it, it was so hidden." That was all. It was clear enough; only he would not see what was before his eyes, nor hear what was in his ears, and so had to grope a little further until Lawrence Newt suddenly struck a light and showed him where he was. He spoke to Amy Waring, and then went straight up to Hope Wayne and put out his hand with the old frank smile breaking over his face. It was but a moment. It was but a word. And for the first time she answered, "Lawrence." "To-morrow, then," said Lawrence Newt as they parted. "To-morrow," echoed Amy Waring and Hope Wayne. It was Aunt Winnifred's firm conviction that societyâ"that is, the great world of which she knew nothingâ"languished for the smile and presence of her nephew, Arthur. "Mercy me, now!" That young man reached his room, and struck a light. He took it up eagerly, then smiled as he saw that it was a tract, and read, "A word to the Unhappy." said he to himself; "does she think a man's griefs are like a child's bumps and bruises, to be cured by applying a piece of paper?" she said, "I love you; look here!" "Fanny, I wish I could do something for Abel." he said to his wife, who paid no more attention to him than to the lamp on the mantle, but, on the contrary, appeared to Hope to be a little more indifferent than before. he said to her abruptly, and in the half-sycophantic, half-bullying tone that indicates the feeling of such a man toward a person to whom he is under immense obligation. Fanny, he is your own flesh and blood." cried he. Yes, yes; let's send him some tracts! And he roared again until the water oozed from his eyes. she said to her, suddenly. "No," she said, "I see no way. Come in, I tell you, and shut the door." If you don't bring me my boots, I'll come and pull the hair out of your head!" Kick. Good-morning, Mrs. It was a whim of Lawrence's to give dinners; to have them good, and to ask only the people he wanted, and who he thought would enjoy themselves together. It was the first time Mrs. Bennet had heard her sister's name mentioned by any stranger for years. he said, gently. "For my son who was dead is alive again. "And well," he continued. It was more than twenty years since the sisters had met, and they clasped each other silently and wept for a long time. It was all they said; and wept again quietly. "I did not dare. Listen, Lucia. "No, no; there is no reason," said her sister, observing it. I could not resist him. said her sister, half-smiling through her sympathetic tears. "Thank God! asked Mrs. Bennet. Well, I gave my child almost his father's name. was all she said. "Amy," said Mrs. Bennet. asked her aunt. Oh Amy, Amy!" "Aunt Lucia, what could I do?" was all that Amy could say. "Well, well, I do not reproach you; I blame nobody. It is too wonderful, wonderful!" "Oh, you mean about Aunt Martha!" said Amy, with an air of relief and surprise. Why, Amy, what on earth did you suppose it was about?" she said, in a low tone, putting out her hand. "Yes, but is not our word as good as his," was the assuring reply. He found him smoking as usual, with a decanter at hand. It was past midnight, and the room was in the disorder of a bachelor's sanctum. Be kind to her, and take care of your heart. Yours, Belch." You, at least, were not born to fail. Yours, A. Newt." "Goslings, are there? "Ally, hey? "Well, well, I thought Abel Newt was smart; but he doesn't even suspect, and I have played a deeper game than was needed." "Likely," replied Newt. "Pretty well." Yes he did. The point of her instructions from Belch was that she was to persuade him to be constant to the Grant at any price. "To-morrow, then, Mr. Newt," she said to him, as they stood together in the crush of a levee at the White Houseâ""our bill is to be reported, and favorably." They moved out of the throng a little, and stood by the window. "I wish I dared to ask you one thing as a pure favor," said the superb Mrs. Delilah Jones, and this time the eyes were firm and bright. His own did not falter. "For my sake, will you speak in favor of it?" she asked, casting her eyes down. He rose, and his first words arrested attention. It was resolved when he sat down. In the midst of the congratulations Abel raised his eyes to Mrs. Delilah Jones, who sat conspicuous in the gallery. So do I. she asked. asked his companion, with wonder and doubt in her voice. she persisted, in a low, doubtful voice. "Kitty, you're a woman still, and I like it. Come, girl, are you afraid?" It was a sensual, seductive sound. "No, I am not afraid," she answered, turning to him. "But, oh! "To-morrow, then?" she said, looking at him, hesitatingly. "To-morrow," he answered, grimly. he asked, roughly. "All our plans." "Well, Kitty," he said at last, thickly, and with glazing eye. "Well, my Princess of the Mediterranean. We shall be happy, hey? he said at length, leering at her through the cigar-smoke. he said at length, looking at his companion, with an indescribable bitterness of sneering. If you are ill some day, I can nurse you. asked Abel, suddenly and angrily. "Where we are going," she replied, gently. "Dâ"â" it, then, don't use such am-am-big-'us phrases. "Thank you," she answered, and rose quietly. she said. I play against Uncle Lawrence, and win. said he, as he opened his sleepy eyes. "Why, it's time to go." she asked. he asked impatiently. "But you won't." He took it up mechanically, and read a paragraph praising him and his speech; foretelling "honor and troops of friends" for a young man who began his public career so brilliantly. said he, as he read it aloud and looked at his companion. "Troops of friends, do you see? It was melancholy merriment. Friends of my soul, farewell! It was a long journey. Mr. Abel, Sir, I congratilate ee, Sir. Ma, sez she, Law, pa! I allers knowed Mr. Abel Newt would turn up trumps. No, of course not. "Why, yes. Sir. It isn't flopdoddle, Sir, but it's solid food." Sly dog, that Uncle Lawrence. I allers sez so. Mr. "Well, well," said Mr. Zephyr Wetherley as he skimmed up Wall Street from the bank, where he had been getting dividends, "I didn't think to see the day when Abel Newt would be a solid, sensible man." "Now sit down." His tone was not to be resisted. He spoke rapidly, but calmly. "I wish we could sail to-night," she said. "Plenty of timeâ"plenty of time," answered Abel. "It seems long to you, too?" "Why, yes; it will be long. Yes, I am going on a long journey." Abel shook his head, mockingly. They were busy with the bills. Abel turned and looked at her, gayly. No, I don't love you. he said, pettishly. It was nine o'clock. "No," said he, "I really can not stand it. I'll run over to town, and be back by midnight. "Why, Kitty, what is it?" he asked, as he stopped. Alarmed for a moment, he leaped up the stairs. exclaimed he, hastily. "You forgot to kiss me, Abel," she said. He took her by the shoulders, and looked at her before him. In her eyes there were pity, and gentleness, and love. he said, half-pleased, half-vexedâ"kissed her, and rushed out into the street. It was bright and full, and he saw many an old friend. So he ventured a little, and won; ventured a little more, and lost. Ventured a little more, and won again; and lost again.
