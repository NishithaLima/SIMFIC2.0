 âEvery one asks me what I âthinkâ of everything,â? undeterred, secretly agitated; not in the least âmindingâ? âOh,â? âI donât say itâs a trifle,â? âAnd you wonder about the flower,â? her visitor echoed; âand I imagine, by the same stroke, quite hideous and offensive.â? âYou donât believe that,â? She just waited, smiling at him.Â âYou see what it has made of me.â? âThe great thing to see,â? âYou mean Iâm good enough?â? âBut twice over,â? âTwice over,â? she repeated.Â âThe very same.â? This did somehow a little speak to him, as it also gratified him.Â âYou dream about me at that rate?â? âAh about him!â? His eyes again sounded her.Â âThen you know all about him.â?Â And as she said nothing more: âWhatâs the wretch like?â? âHe has been dodging, retreating, hiding, but now, worked up to anger, heâll fight!â?â"this intense impression made a single mouthful, as it were, of terror and applause.Â But what was wondrous was that the applause, for the felt fact, was so eager, since, if it was his other self he was running to earth, this ineffable identity was thus in the last resort not unworthy of him.Â It bristled thereâ"somewhere near at hand, however unseen stillâ"as the hunted thing, even as the trodden worm of the adage must at last bristle; and Brydon at this instant tasted probably of a sensation more complex than had ever before found itself consistent with sanity.Â It was as if it would have shamed him that a character so associated with his own should triumphantly succeed in just skulking, should to the end not risk the open; so that the drop of this danger was, on the spot, a great lift of the whole situation.Â Yet with another rare shift of the same subtlety he was already trying to measure by how much more he himself might now be in peril of fear; so rejoicing that he could, in another form, actively inspire that fear, and simultaneously quaking for the form in which he might passively know it. âSaved,â? he wondered, his eyes rising to her, âonly, in the name of all the benedictions, how?â? âAnd now I keep you,â? she said. âOh keep me, keep me!â? âI was uneasy.Â You were to have come, you rememberâ"and you had sent no word.â? she said, âthat youâve been coming.â? âAh but I didnât!â? she repeated, âitâs not you!Â Of course it wasnât to have been.â? âAh but it was,â? âYou couldnât!â? His eyes, as he lay, turned back to her.Â âWhat more then?â? âSaw meâ"?â? âSaw him,â? âYou came to yourself,â? âAh Iâve come to myself nowâ"thanks to you, dearest.Â But this brute, with his awful faceâ"this bruteâs a black stranger.Â Heâs none of me, even as I might have been,â? she said, âyou appeared to me.â? âLike him?â? she strangely smiled, âshouldnât I like him?â? âI could have liked him.Â And to me,â? she said, âhe was no horror.Â I had accepted him.â? he grudgingly, resentfully asked. âHe has been unhappy, he has been ravaged,â? she said. âAnd havenât I been unhappy?Â Am not Iâ"youâve only to look at me!â"ravaged?â? âAh I donât say I like him better,â? âAnd he isnâtâ"no, he isnâtâ"you!â? she murmured, as he drew her to his breast.
