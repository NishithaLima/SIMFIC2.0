 A.L. "I don't think you make good company, anyway, with your questions and your athwarts," Harleston retorted amiably, as Clarke and he moved off. asked Clarke. "Naturallyâ"it's not in you to give praise undeserved." "Again showing her astonishing cleverness." "Why, would you believe it," Clarke added, "the deep snow of last February lay on the walks untouched until well into the following day. "Once or twice. What had he here! As he opened the door, the sleeping horse came suddenly to life; with a snort it struggled to its feet, then looked around apologetically at Harleston, as though begging to be excused for having been caught in a most reprehensible act for a cab horse. On the cushion of the seat was a light lap spread, part of the equipment of the cab. He turned up the cushion and felt under it: nothing. On the floor, however, was a woman's handkerchief, filmy and small, and without the least odour clinging to it. Extinguishing the match, he caught it up. Then, after noting the number of the cab, No. They were the usual American Beauties; only larger and more gorgeous than the general runâ"which might be taken as an indication of the wealth of the giver, or of the male desire to please the female; or of both. "This is quite a surprise. He knew from experience the futility of attempting the solution of a cipher by any but an expert; and even with an expert it was rarely successful. "And what are to be the stakes now, I wonder," he mused. Under all the circumstances, I should say the latter is the more likely. "I'm sure bewitched!" he remarked, going on to his bedroom. "It's not difficult for me to understand the Duke of Lotzen. So we're both quits on that score, if we're not quite on some others." he muttered. "Is that Mr. "I am Mr. Harleston," he replied courteouslyâ"the voice had done it. "Oh, how do you do, Mr. "No." "Or even a divorcÃ©e." "Yes." "And doing the Maxixe at the Willard, this minute." she laughed. "All of which is charming of you, Mr. Harleston but it's not exactly the business I have in hand." he exclaimed. she asked. "Yourself, mademoiselle. "And the business in hand depends primarily on whether you are interested in the subject matter of the business, n'est-ce pas?" "And who on his part is so graciousâ"and wasn't asleep," she answered. He thought so. "You guessed it," he replied. "No, no, mademoiselle! "I don't understand," said Harleston. "Hence, your name?" "When we meet, you'll know me by my voice." she laughed. "What do you intend to do, sir, in regard to the incident of the deserted cab with the sleeping horse?" she asked. "Not at all! "What do you wish me to do, Madame X?" she mocked. she laughed. "No, to me." she laughed. she whispered. "In other words, I have a chance to get them. "Precisely." "Very well, I accept. Make the appointment, Mr. "Perfectlyâ"if it can't be sooner," she replied, after a momentary pause. "And the place?" she laughed. "Don't you know, Madame X, that Peacock Alley is one of the most dangerous places in town?" "Keep these for me until tomorrow, Stuart." Someone was there. he asked, blinking into their levelled revolvers. They were medium-sized men and wore evening clothes; one was about forty-five and rather inclined to stoutness, the other was under forty and rather slender. They were not masked, and their faces, which were strange to Harleston, were the faces of men of breeding, accustomed to affairs. "It was thoughtless of me," Harleston returned. "Certainly, sir," the elder smiled. "This is Mr. Sparrow; I am Mr. Marston. "Thank you, very much," said Harleston, as he struck the match and carefully passed the flame across the tip. he inflected. "By all means!" "Pray, proceed. was the answer. Make yourselves perfectly at home, sirs." "Good-night." "He acts the part," said the elder. "There's nothing but to overturn everything in the placeâ"and so on; and that will require a day." "Bang away, sirs, bang away! "What did you say?" Like a flash, the latter's revolver shifted to him. said he. said he. "I don't fancyâ"produce the goods!" But you'll facilitate the search if you'll depress your respective cannon from the angle of each other's anatomy and get to work. "Thank you," said Harleston. "It was courtesy at first, and the novelty of the experience; but it's ceased to be novel, and courtesy is a bit supererogatory. The three shook their heads. "I'm off," said Marston. "Beat it, my man!" "Good-night, sirâ"and pleasant dreams. Come on, Crenshaw." he exclaimed. "Good-morning, Miss Williams," he said. "Pretty long, Mr. Harleston," the girl answered. "You certainly are. "I don't think!" she laughed. "Only when you're downâ"otherwise it's not half bad. "No, no, let him go. she laughed. "Sure." "Very good, Mr. "Who has No. she laughed. "No. "Not a word, Mr. Harlestonâ"and thank you." Good-night, sir. "All of which shows," reflected Harleston, as he returned to bed, "that the telephone people are right in asking you to smile when you say 'hello.'" Tomorrow was another day. I do." "I hope you'll come around to tell me at a more seasonable hour. "I thought as much!" he exclaimed. Put up your gun, man; I'm not dangerous." "All right, stay there, then!" the other panted. "In your case, an outcry would be embarrassing only to yourself." "What do you intend to do with me?" "Ultimately, you mean. I have not decided. "In your pockets." I have been injected into this matter; and having been injected I intend to ascertain what can be found from your papers. "My turn will come, never fear." "A far day, monsieur, a far day!" First, your pocketbook." he queried. The note, apparently in a woman's handwriting, was in French, and contained five words and an initial: Ã l'aube du jour. "Thank you!" said he, with an amused smile. "Why not?" the other retorted. "Why not spread your cards on the table, Crenshaw?" he asked. "I did stumble on the deserted cab this morning, wholly by accident; I was on my way here. "Very well. A knock came at the door. Now drive on with the story." He paused, and looked again at the picture. "What do you make out of it, Mr. he asked. "Not a great deal cursorily," he answered. It is the one cipher that needs no code-book, nor anything else that can be lost or stolenâ"the code-word can be carried in one's mind. "I thought that you might be able to work it out," said Harleston. 333, but we are investigating now. "There's a woman in it, I believe; likely two, possibly three!" was the smiling reply. "Very well," Ranleigh replied. "I thought it might be your Lady of Peacock Alley, for it's about the cab matter. he asked, placing a chair for herâ"where her face would be in full view from the cabinet. Pray proceed, my dear Mrs. Winton." The woman disappeared into the house. After walking a short distance, and in front of a vacant lot near the corner, he haltedâ"obviously he realized that no one was holding the lines, and he was waiting for his driver to return. I waited for further developments from the house. After waiting a short while, I went to bed. "Not much, I fancy. he asked. she admitted. said she. he smiled. "I'm afraid I can't be of much help," Mrs. Winton replied. "What about the house, Mrs. Winton? "And the Department is much indebted to you for the information, and it appreciates the spirit that moves you in the matter." "Don't you wish to know the result?" he inquired with a quizzical smile, as he put her in the car. she laughed. "I don't recall it!" "No." "What do you think of her?" "Good to look at, truthful, sincere." He nodded to some acquaintances, bowed formally to others, shook hands when it could not be avoided; all the while progressing slowly down the corridor in search of three red roses on a black gown. He knew neither, but there was the chance that the one he was to meet knew him. "Why, how do you do, Mr. Harleston," she smiled, giving him her hand and making room beside her on the settee. "Only yesterday! "Yes, off and on. "I'm ready, I'm sure," she replied. he interjected. They were dancing the Maxixe when they entered. said she. "So do I," said he, and they drifted down the room. He knew almost everyone on the floor; the women nodded to him, then stared coldly at his companion; the men too stared at herâ"but not coldlyâ"and when they thought about it, which was seldom of late, nodded to him, and resumed their staring. "This is perfectly entrancing, Mr. Harleston," she said presently, "but don't you think we would better hunt a retired corner and discuss other matters?" Her smile grew into a quiet, rippling laugh. "Very good, sir," she smiled; "I am not afraid of the light." she asked. "Why, indeed?" he replied. "And why, may I ask, did you meet me here this afternoon?" "And why do you think I wanted to meet you?" he replied. "And that chance depends on a number of contingencies," he replied: "whether I have the desired articles; whether you have the title to them, or the right of possession to them; whether they concern private matters or public matters; if the latter, whether the United States is concerned." "I know for a fact that you took the articles in question from the cab, which you found deserted before a vacant lot." "How do you know it?" he laughed. "On the ground that it will incriminate you?" she asked quickly. he asked. He looked at her thoughtfully. "Very well," he returned. she smiled, holding it up. "Begin at the beginning," he advised. "To begin at the beginning will make it a long story," she warned. she smiled, with a tantalizing glance from the brown eyes. "No hurry, my dear Madame X." "Don't you want my decision as to dinner?" she asked. Now to begin." The woman was sinuous, with raven hair, dead white complexion, a perfectly lovely face, and a superb figure. he smiled. "No, not about her." "I best get on with my tale," she said. On the boat was a Madame Durrand, whom I had known on the Continent and in London for a number of years. she smiled. "And the affair rather fascinated me, I admit, by its unusualness. Here is where you come in.' she said. I answered. said he. said I. "'Very well,' said I; 'I'm Mrs. said he. "'How did you know'â"I began, then stopped. he replied. On the envelope I had written the instruction that it was not to be delivered until morning. he exclaimed excitedly. "'Listen, Mrs. asked the man. No trouble at all, Seraphina.' I gasped. someone asked. "'Nothing,' another replied. I protested. "'Come, come!' I demanded. "'The package is not with me,' I remarked. she asked, with an amused smile. I knew it was a threat. I inquired. she smiled. The rest of the tale you know much better than Iâ"and the material portion you are to tell me, or rather to give me." You didn't recognize me in the corridor, this afternoon." "It was about three when you telephoned to meâ"where were you then?" he asked. They were kind enough to release me about three o'clock, and to send me back in a private carâ"at least, it wasn't a taxi. "I am satisfied," he replied. she said joyfully. "And what of the roses?" She held out her hand, the most symmetrical hand Harleston had ever seen. "My letter, please, Mr. "What does it all mean?" she asked, leaning forward. she asked quickly. she demanded. "Tell him the exact truth," said Harleston. "I thought you would return the letter to me," she replied. "I likely should, had I seen you before I turned it over to the State Department. "Advised, yes,â"dominated, no. she mocked. "I'm afraid you'll find the wheels of justice very slow-movingâ"when they have to do with affairs diplomatic." "No!" "This is Police Headquarters, Mr. Harleston," came the voice over the wire. They were gone! said he under his breath, and turned toward the corner where he had left Mrs. Clephane. He took a turn up and down the corridor, and up and down again. They were not there. said he, at lengthâ"and returned to the red-room, and to his chair. He waited for a quarter of an hour, and she did not come. He looked at his watchâ"it was half-after-seven o'clock. It's No. He got off at the ninth floor and walked down the corridor to No. 972. "I am indeed," said Sparrow. "We're not debating, we're searching," Crenshaw sneered; "though it may occur to you that a copy is as easy of translation as the original. "There's no bait like a pretty woman!" "I don't understand!" "Certainly, Mr. Harleston," the man replied; and, directing the others to examine the baggage, he closed the door of the drawing-room. "It was, the office says, occupied by a Mr. and Mrs. Davidson of New York City, who took it this afternoon about five o'clock. "Yes," nodded Harleston, "I thought as much. I'll pay for the broken table and its contents, and a proper charge for the rooms for the few hours they've been occupied. "Certainly, sir." "Very good!" 972. The note was a forgery. He took up his stick and gloves, put on his hat so as to shade, as far as possible, the cheek-bone, and went down to the private office. On the slender chance of finding Mrs. Clephane, Harleston made another tour of the rooms and corridor on the first floor. We are always at the service of the government, particularly the State Department." "What do you know of her?" he asked, indicating No. 717. "Two bedrooms, a parlour, and a bath." "Very good, sir," said Banks, and went out. As to him, Mrs. Spencer was not concerned. 410." "Why, Guy!" "What a surprise this is!" "And what a charming pleasure to me, Madeline," he added, taking both her hands and holding them. "I thought you were in Paris; indeed, I thought you would never leave the City of Boulevards." "So did I, yet here I am; yet not for long, I trust, Guy, not for long." she laughed. he smiled, and handed her into a chair. "You were much surprised to see me, n'est-ce pas?" she asked low, leaning close. "Much more than much," he replied confidentially. she asked, still low and close. "Much more than honest," he answered. she asked quickly. "I don't knowâ"the impression was vivid enough, while it lasted, for you to have been in the room." "I'm sure of it," he replied. "Why not get a penchant for me, as well?" she mocked "Meaning that I can't get a penchant, or that I am not afraid to declare?" she laughed. What have you been doing, and what are you doing?" "Of course, but what else?" "And what adventure befell you on the wayâ"if any?" "Perfectly. "Oh, to be sure!" "You know that I wasn't!" she replied. he inquired blandly. "I dreamed it." She nodded tolerantly. she asked. "You know that I am concerned in your adventureâ"just as I know of your adventure. "Not at all!" he replied. "No!" she adjected. "What does that matter to youâ"since it does not belong to you?" he smiled. she asked. he inflected. she smiled. she said sorrowfully. He nodded. "With whom, then, has it to do?" he inquired placidly. she breathed. "And what is the business?" he continued. he went on. I'm on staff duty, so to speak. She looked at him thoughtfully. "I'm sure of it," he replied. "Sometime, I hope, we can try it." "Why not try it now?" she said gently. He shook his head. he smiled. he asked. "Unfortunately, I don't." "Precisely, old friend, precisely." she smiled. he demanded. said she. "To you." "Not at all. "Certainly, I will," he responded gravely, and arose. she mocked. Now, smiling adorably, she came to meet him. "I don't understandâ"but I'll do as you direct," she murmured. "I'm an imbecile, or a child in arms." "I did not. "Not of my own experience, Mrs. Clephane," she replied confidentially, "but I have it from those who do know, that he set a merry pace and travelled the limit with his fair companions. "It's no particular trick to make men's hearts flutter," said Mrs. Clephane sweetly. "No instance. was the quick yet drawling answer. "Thank you so much," was Mrs. Clephane's answer. "Good-night, Guy," she murmured.â""No, sir, not a foot; I'm going up to my apartment." Come, Mr. he asked. "Not at all," said she. "Thank you!" she smiled. "Why not quit right now, Mrs. I'm angry all through. Don't I look angry, Mr. "Only you don't look it now." she smiled. she asked. I escaped. she marvelled. He nodded. "I hope I'm looking half that I feel," she replied instantly. she smiled. "It's not in the line of diplomacy, I hope," she shrugged. "Thank you, Mr. she said gently, permitting him, for an instant, to look deep into her brown eyes. That is why it hit me so hard, Mr. Harleston. he laughed. "I know her history; it's something of a history, too.... she cried. he smiled. she asked. She trusts me." she asked. "I don't know anyone on the staff, but Mrs. Durrand has likely communicated with the Embassy." he smiled. she asked. That was not done; but Spencer, you may assume, has attempted to rectify their blunderâ"possibly by impersonating you, and giving the Marquis d'Hausonville some tale that will fall in with her plans and gain time for her." "Yes. "I thought also that diplomacy was the gentlest-mannered profession in the worldâ"and the most dignified." she marvelled. "I do. "And when it has to do with those of the profession?" "Pretty much," he admitted. "Again I'm well content to be simply an ordinary woman, whose chief delight and occupation is clothes and the wearing of clothes." "Some there are who would not agree with you," she replied. The Marquis would instantly want to know what such a move on my part meant. I'm lost in the maze. "You may talk to me forever," he replied. "And what as to the French Ambassador?" she asked. "Tomorrow, then, is beyond the forever?" "Tomorrow may take care of itself!" "Don't be sacrilegious, sir." I hurried to the elevator. I'm sort of becoming accustomed to being abducted and kindred innocent amusements. "Certainly. "In diplomacy!" he acquiesced. he laughed, drawing out his watch. "Take me to the F Street elevator and then hurry on," said she. he asked. he broke in. "Good-night, Mr. she smiledâ"and the car shot upward. "Yes, sir, two hours ago; he'll not be back tonight." "Yes, sir, Mr. Harleston.... Yes, I recognized the voice. You didn't?... Yes, I saw him in the Chateau this evening.... What?... Yes, in the Collingwood.... He knew there was no sympathy and no excuse for the detective who let his prisoner escape. "It served him right. He will be fortunate if his want of precaution doesn't cost him his job." "No, no!" "Very good, sir," Ranleigh acquiesced. he asked. "She must be a vision." "Only to you impressible chaps!" "Tomorrow, at four?" "If I can get the lady, certainly." "Very well; it won't be the first time I've had the pleasure of seeing moonshine. he asked, as he entered the latter's office. he remarked, coming out of his abstraction. He took up a small book and opened it at a mark. "Lord, Carpenter. he exclaimed. he asked as he wrote. "Only this isolated phrase?" "I don't want to hold that at present." "What do you know about Mrs. he asked. "And whichever it is, you've shown your wisdom. Don't spoil it now, Harleston, don't spoil it now. Don't do it, old man, don't do it!" "Don't do what?" "Don't fall in love with Mrs. You won't drive over me." "I know only what Mrs. Clephane has told me," Harleston replied. "I seem to be in wrong, old man," he said. "Quite long enough for a man disposed to make a fool of himselfâ"if the lady is a beauty." "Certainly!" "I know of that," returned Harleston, "also that Clephane was a rouÃ©, and generally an exceedingly rotten lot." "Preciselyâ"and her conduct as to him may be quite justifiable; yet nevertheless it weakens her credibility; puts her story as to the letter under suspicion. "How do you know all this?" "I did." "Yes," said Harleston. "Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Clephane.... Very nice, indeed.... Be delighted!... In ten minutes, I'll be there. she said. "No, no, sir!" she smiled. "We're to be friends," he returned. "Ergo," she replied. she reminded him. "I don't dislike compliments, Mr. Harleston; but compliments, it seems, are given in diplomacy for a purpose; and as I don't understand anything of diplomacy we would better cut them outâ"until we have finished with diplomacy. he smiled, looking into the brown eyes with frank admiration. "Besides, I want to ask you a favour. he asked. "For your sake as well as for my own," he explained. "I know no one in Washington except the friends at the Shoreham, and they are not residents here." It is the right thing to do. I waited. Someone would be sure to see us and report to the Embassy that I had brought youâ"the natural effect of which would be to make the Marquis disbelieve your tale. she asked. "Quite the contrary," he smiled. she laughed. "Careful, Mr. she reminded. she said, speaking in French. he inquired. "I am Mrs. Clephane," she replied in French. he asked, this time in French. he asked. "Again, no," she replied. she whispered as she passed himâ"and the look that went with the words cleared all her scoresâ"and almost finished him. The Marquis nodded. said she. He laughed lightly. he replied, also in English, "Pray proceed." the Marquis asked. "Very possibly. the Marquis reminded. he smiled. "Not of diplomats, only of their professional ways. he asked. "And what, if you care to tell, did he say?" the Marquis chuckled. The Marquis threw up his hands. It's unfortunate, but it's not as unfortunate as it might be." "You make me feel much, oh, so much better!" the Marquis smiled. "No, oh, no! he interjected. "Alas, no! she asked. "Don't give it a thought," he assured her. He took her hand, escorted her with gracious courtesy to the door, and bowed her out. the Marquis asked. "I did, sir," the First Secretary replied. "Very good, madame!" "It was all easy enough if the blundering fools had only exercised an atom of sense," Mrs. Spencer retorted. she asked sharply. "What do you think France will do?" "What are you talking about?" she demanded. "Have been, Marston?" she inflected. "Have beenâ"and am," he bowed. "Only what, Marston?" "So, to you, I'm a game?" "Of an impossible sort," he replied. "Much more than satisfied; very much more than satisfied." She held out her hand to him, and smiled ravishingly. And Marston knew it, too. She nodded. "Not yet. He will duly apprise me. "Of course. "Certainlyâ"but I shan't be fool enough to tell him so, or anything as to the letter. "No, in Union Station." "It likely will beâ"one way or the other," she returned drily. He took the hand, and bending over raised it to his lips with an air of fine courtesy and absolute devotion. "I don't know," she answered. It's worth the trial, it seems to me." "I know a number of keys of French ciphers; one of them may fit." "Very well," said she quietly; "you are empowered to have a try at Carpenter." Yes, a very useful and satisfactory man. "Why, where is it!" Or did she drop it?... All the rest were there. On the way out she stepped into a telephone booth, and directed the dispatcher at the Chateau to send a taxi to Brentano's for Mrs. Williams. "Why, how do you do, Mrs. he exclaimed. "This is an unexpected pleasure, and most opportune." he asked. "You may call a taxi," she replied; "and you may also come with me, if you've nothing else to do." "I'm too sorry. I have an important appointment at the Capitol." she asked. "I'm at the Chateau." "I hope tomorrow, if I'm not suddenly tied up. she smiled. "Wherever you suggest," she replied. he laughed. We must do better now, old friend. "Not today. "I like you, Billy!" "Very well, Mr. Harleston," she replied. Then she lowered her voice. he asked. "I don't know. As he opened the door, the telephone rang. He took up the receiver. "Is that you, Mr. he smiled. she inflected. "Only to one person." "What are you doing?" I have something important to discuss." "So have I," he replied. he asked. "Your mental methods," she replied. he exclaimed. "You may explain at dinner." "Certainlyâ"and forever after, Mr. Harleston, be an ordinary man with me, please." he asked. "In other words, I'm not a seeing man?" Ã bientÃ´t, Monsieur Harleston." he inquired of Miss Williams. "None," she replied. "All right," said he. "How do you do, Mr. said she, with a broad smile. "Hello, Mrs. Spencer! It's at the door." he asked. he inquired;â"and when she nodded he leaned forward and gave the order. she laughed. "You were not; nor am I to see you. We are too old foes to pretend as to the non-essentialsâ"when each knows them. he asked. "All of mine." "What am I concealing?" she demanded. "I don't know. she asked. "It was so mysterious; and so full of possibilities," he smiled. "And when I did it, I didn't know that you were interested." she smiled, and shrugged his answer aside. she asked. "Precisely," he agreed, "We understand each other and the game." Now it was ended. He knew it. he asked. "And seen?" "And seen." he smiled. she repeated. he exclaimed. tentatively. she added. she resumed. he exclaimed. He nodded. Both knew it, and both knew the answer. he asked. The woman who is honest about the tincture, or the woman who is not. said she, looking at him narrowly. "In his office. "I don't know what your play is," she laughed, "but I'll meet himâ"and take my chances. To either you or me, Guy, he should be easy." "Very good!" she repliedâ""but all the same I wonder what's the game." "I've quite a lot to tell you," she smiled. "Time is not of the essence of this contract," he replied. she asked, with a fetching little frown of perplexity. "Preciselyâ"and then some," he confided. she asked. "The 'more' and the 'may' are in the future," she remarked. "Very considerable," said he. she cried. He nodded. A short time after, the three men called." she breathed. "I'm France, am I?" she smiled. she laughed. "It was blocked by a present," he remarked. "On the contrary, you have performed it exceptionally well. she responded. "It is?" said he, advancing slowly toward her. she laughed. "In diplomacy," he appended. "Don't be cynical," he cautioned. The world looks good to me, and I try to look good to the world." he exclaimed. she asked. "It can't be done," he averred. "What a paragon ofâ"" â""everything," he adjected. he replied. Want dinner, Mr. When you are ready, madame, I am ready too. he guessed. she mocked. On the contrary, remembering diplomatic ways, I most cordially invited her in. "'Mrs. she asked. "Again I acquiesced. I admit, I was curious. I asked. "'It doesn't,' said I. I asked. "Naturally, I understood. he smiled. she cut in. "There's no 'go on,'" he explained. "I don't know!" she laughed. "And the appointment to the German Secret Service?" "I don't know; she didn't say and I didn't ask. "Yes." We are watching The Snake, of course. It's the lady he's after, not her mission. "Is that you, Harleston?... was the answer. "You may have need of it; if you do, it will be very convenient." "What did he say to that?" "Very good! "Casually," said Carpenter. "No. "Rather the reverse, I should say. That was the important point, however. "This is Mr. Harleston," said he. "I'd know it anywhere, indeed." "No, no!" she laughed. See you tomorrow, old enemy. He got the Chateau and, giving his name, asked whether Mrs. Clephane was on the first floor of the hotel. he exclaimed. said she. "What do you wonder?" said he. "Is that Mr. he demanded. Good-night, Mon camarade." he tossed back, softly. she asked. she smiled. "What a faithful friend you are; always seeing my few good points and being blind to my many bad." "I know itâ"and I am very, very grateful." she asked. Someone was coming." he exclaimed. putting out her hand to him. "By all means let us to the business in hand." "To persuasion, no; to exchange, yes. She nodded slightly. she asked. "And that you'll go into temporary confinement?" she smiled. he smiled back. I may not explain now, Marston. But you must obtain a copy of the letter; it's but a fair exchange for the French code, you know; and you're permittedâ"nay you're authorized, in the interest of the serviceâ"to allow Carpenter to copy the book if he will give you the letter to copy. She nodded. he asked. As it was, he was only a plaything. "I must dress, and you're rather de trop at such a time, however much you may be welcome at another. If I'm detained, wait." "I'm at the Collingwood, Madeline. was the answer. "Yes. "Yes." said she softly. "Not always," he laughed, "but I will be this time." she greeted. he laughed. she asked. she smiled, her head on her hand, her eyes on him. she said, melting into another pose. he exclaimed. she asked, gliding into another posture, even more alluring. "You know I mean it," he declared. she answered. she inflected, "I wonder, Guy." He nodded, slowly but none-the-less definitely. "Not a weak woman, Madeline," he replied. He wondered what more was coming, and at what directed. "No, no, Guy," said she. It's the simple truth I'm about to tell you, and as truth I pray you take it." Entirely the reverse, Guy. "Thank you, Guy," said she. she smiled, and forced his hand. "I do mean it," he replied. She looked at him contemplatively, trying to read behind his words. he asked. she said speculatively. he smiled, more puzzled than ever. she whispered, putting out her hand to him and smiting him with a ravishing smileâ"a smile such as she had had for but one other man. she inflected. "I'm afraid it's not so much my honour as your love," she said. I have not changed, but you have. Why is it, Guy?" she mocked. But you know what it is, Madeline. I'm sorry, supremely sorry. she asked mockingly; "or is Mrs. Clephane's character whiter than mine?" he smiled. "I thought you believed me, Guy. he replied. "And the next lead is yours!" she laughed back. "Ask Mrs. she suggested. "Do it? "Damn Mrs. she said softly. "How are we to work it, Mr. "As allies," Marston replied. "Very well," said Carpenter, briskly. "Correct, isn't it?" as he ended. "By all means," said Carpenter. The prescience was come. he suggested, taking up a test card. They tried it, and the next, and all the rest. "I don't quite understand their game," Carpenter chuckled, as he turned away, "but it's no matter.

"Don't do it again," he cautioned. "It was very dangerous." "I don't know if you will remember me, Mrs. Clephane," said Carpenter, coming across.

He will keep his hands off, you may believe." "What are you going to do, Mr. he smiled. "And what are you going to do with me, Mr. she smiled. "No, with me." he smiled. "Certainly not, sir. she whispered. "And they're coming this way." "Very good!" "Too pleasant," he returned. "I've something to tell you as to it and her, when the present matter is ended."

"The other car is just ahead, sir," he reported. "Very good," said Harleston. "I've signalled, sir, and he's answered." "Maintain the distance," Harleston directed. "Yes sir," said the man. "This is fortunate, Mrs. he exclaimed. On the chance of overtaking you, I beat it after you. she asked, with her compelling smile. "What did you do with Mrs. she asked, when they were started. "I left her at the Rataplan," he replied. "I don't recall that I said it, Madeline, but your information is correct." she smiled. "Small matter. He'll see you, all right." "Except with you," she murmured. he exclaimed. "Yes, Guyâ"but not now," she whispered. "Now, I'm strong!" he laughed, bluntly declining the overture. he approved. "I don't know anything more pleasantâ"unless it is the finishing stroke of an affaire Diplomatique." "In due time." she inflected. she asked. she asked, as they went up the steps from the sidewalk. "What do you wish me to do?" he inquired. She saw where she stood, and what was coming. "How do you do, Mrs. "I know what you are about to do," the smile said. "Now do it if you can. she cut in. she marvelled. "Absurd, sir!" she replied. she laughed, perching her lithe length on the arm of a chair, one slender foot swinging slowly back and forth. "Your play, monsieur." she laughed. she asked. she laughed, with a sweeping motion to her narrow lingerie gown that could not so much as conceal a pocket.

"This is Ranleigh," came the voice. she asked. she laughed. "Tell him, if I can shoot, Guy," she ordered. "Try it, Mr. Secretary, and find out!" she laughed across the levelled revolver. she jeered.
