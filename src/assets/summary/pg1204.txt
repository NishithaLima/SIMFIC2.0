 in a welcoming tone. Men never do know, until it is all over. Also, not enough comfort and not enough love. Bud exploded again. Why, good Lord! âYes, you willâ"not!â? âYou do, and see whatâll happen! âAw, forget that! Oh, well, why go into details? Bud fought back, telling Marie how much of a snap she had had since she married him, and how he must have looked like ready money to her, and added that now, by heck, he even had to do his own cooking, as well as listen to her whining and nagging, and that there wasnât clean corner in the house, and sheâd rather let her own baby go hungry than break a simp rule in a darn book got up by a bunch of boobs that didnât know anything about kids. He wouldnât go near the darn place again, except to get his clothes. he said stolidly. Get that.â? This, you must know, was not in the courtroom, so Bud was not fined for contempt. He would have to borrow money for his next meal, if he did that, and Bud was touchy about such things. âOh, driving a car Iâm taking south. The manâs eyebrows lifted, but since Bud did not explain, he went on with his own explanation. âYou donât remember me, but I rode into Big Basin with you last summer. This isnât any booster parade. You go there to-night, get the car, and have it down at the Broadway Wharf to meet the 11:30 boatâ"the one the theater crowd uses. The man laughed. âNot much, or I wouldnât have picked you for the trip.â? Foster had a good-looking house, he observed. Still, there was not much chance of her going out in the fogâ"and now that he listened, he heard the drip of rain. No, there was not much chance. Foster had not seemed to think there was any chance of the car being in use, and Foster ought to know. He would wait until about ten-thirty, to play safe, and then go. He waited another minute and crawled out. Huh. He would have to fill the gas tank, and get more oil, and he wanted to test the air in his tires. He would much rather run the gauntlet of that driveway then wait in the dark any longer. He would give father-in-law a chance to throw a fit, next morning. âO-oh, boy!â? Feet came hurrying. said one. Foster settled back on the cushions with a sigh. And keep going, till I tell you to stop. âFull up. âNah. Side streets, if you know any. âLeave it to me, brother.â? ââ"if he gets next,â? âAh, quit your worrying,â? Foster grunted. Foster snapped, just coming out of a doze. âYou ought to know, with your own carâ"and gas costing what it does.â? Foster yawned aloud. Foster and his friend would remain in the car. somewhere in the South. He wanted to get somewhere quickly and quietly, and Bud was getting him there. âAw, whatâs the difference? Foster reached forward and took a thermos bottle, his partner seized another. he grunted sarcastically. âWhere are you fellows going, anyway?â? he asked impatiently. âYuma!â? snapped Foster. âYou shut up, Mert. âYuma. You hit the shortest trail for Yuma, Bud. Foster seemed distinctly out of humor. Still, such a car generally means a good deal to the owner, and he did not wonder that Foster was nervous about it. Foster and Mert evidently had no intention whatever of showing themselves. Which went far toward proving that the crime had been carefully planned in advance. Foster had almost pounced upon the newspaper when he discovered it in Budâs pocket as he climbed in, and Bud knew that the two read that feature article avidly. He would be in jail now, instead of splashing along the highway many miles to the south. For such was his vengeful desire. he demanded. Bud snapped. âGo on. Foster urged. âOh, we canât kick, Mert,â? Foster smoothed him down diplomatically. Foster extracted a bank note from his bill-folder, which Bud observed had a prosperous plumpness, and held it out to Bud. But I only want half, right now. Maybe,â? Foster leaned forward to ask, his tone flattering with the praise that was in it. As long as this old boat will travel,â? Foster leaned forward to ask senselessly. Bud retorted, still watching the road and steering with one hand. She never has,â? Foster answered dubiously. Foster observed weakly. âYeah,â? Well, weâll have a look.â? he suggested tentatively. Foster got out and stood around, offering suggestions that were too obvious to be of much use, but which Bud made it a point to follow as far as was practicable. Foster said it must be the carburetor, and Bud went relentlessly after the carburetor. cried Bud, looking reproachfully in at Foster. âYou tell me, and Iâll fix it,â? Bud retorted savagely. he said, âbut it ainât that. I can take off the mag. She looks dry as a bone, and clean. at all. Bud swore a little and got out more tools and went after the magneto with grim determination. Bud retorted acidly. whined Mert. Foster interposed pacifically. he asked pathetically. âOnly, she wonât go.â? He waited, watching Fosterâs face. Foster chewed a corner of his lip worriedly. His tone was helpless. Only, he didnât start. he stated, after a minute of dismal silence. Foster looked at him, looked at Bud, looked at the car and at the surrounding hills. he asked Bud spiritlessly after a while. Darned hick burg.â? Foster studied awhile. Eh, Mert? he said naively. I want some dry socks to put on when I get there.â? Foster very obligingly tilted the suit case over into the front seat. âYou can say that weâre from Los Angeles, and on our way home,â? Foster told him curtly. âFine. âNot a chance in the world, chief. Adios.â? âHowdy, howdy,â? âYou lost?â? âYes. I am, and I ainât.â? âYeahâ"how about some supper? We will,â? Bud found the bacon and cut according to his appetite. âYeah. cried Bud, holding out the frying pan emptied of all but grease. the other chuckled. He, spread his hands with an air of finality. âYeah. Bannock looks about done, so weâll eat.â? âSuits me fine to go with you,â? Bud declared. And I know the open. Fair enough,â? Howâll that be, Bud?â? Bud retorted with faint mimicry. First, there was the outfit. Sat. Apr. 1. Much smoke, ripped hole in back of tent. Apr. 2. Apr. 3. Snow going fast. Fine sunny day. Apr. 4. Very boggy and moist. Apr.5. Start out, on Monte & Pete at 6. Feed fine all over. Cash told him many things out of his past, while they poked along, driving the packed burros before them. May 6. Up at sunrise. Bud found them 3 miles South near Indian village. Bud cut his hair, did a good job. Prospector dropped into camp with fist full of good looking quartz. Very hot Tied Monte & Pete up for night. May 8. Up 5:30. Fine, but hot. Feed as usual, desert weeds. Flies horrible. May 9. Up 4. Left 6. Feed as usual. R.R. May 11. Up at sunrise. Tested rock. Up 4. Got it in his mouth, tongue, feet & all over body. Very hot & all suffered from heat. Very hot so laid around camp all day. Moon almost full, lots of mocking birds. Pretty songs. Day promises hot, but slight breeze. Hunted twice but impossible to track them in this stony soil Bud followed trail, found them 2 mi. Bud swore it was Monte & Pete. I threw up my breakfast. Very hot weather. and other rattlers. June 10. Prospected & found 8 ledges. Bud found none. June 11. Cleaned guns. Bud took a bath. June 12. Other burros did not. Burros came in at 9:30. June 13.

Too hot. June 21. Burros did not miss their daily drink. June 22. Cash took a bath. Burros did not come to water. June 25. Worried about Cash. June 26. Bud very sick & out of head. No sleep for either. Burros came in for water about daylight. June 27. Bud same, slept most of day. Burros came at about 3 but could not drink owing to bees around water hold. Burros put for hills again. No way of driving off bees. June 28. Burros came & drank in night. Best can do under circumstances. June 29. Very hot all day, breeze like blast from furnace. Burros refuse to leave flat. Bud worse. July 4th. Terrible hot, strong gusty wind. Doing fine. Prospected west of ranche. Burros came in after dark, all but Cora & Colt, which arrived about midnight. July 5. Burros trickled in sometime during night. Took them off. Bud very restless. July 6. Burros came in about 5. July 7. Hot. Coraâs colt ainât with âem though. âYeah. Promising ledge, too. Like some people, though. Now,â? âYeah. Coraâs nothing but a bag of bones, too. And pack light.â? he said. Do you?â? grinned Bud. âYeah.â? âWhere itâs green.â? he said. âYeah. And,â? âYou said a mouthful, Cash. No, nor a whole row of âemâ"if there was a whole row.â? Bud murmured, with the corners of his mouth twitching. âSuits me,â? said Cash. He would starve. he would chuckle. The burros and the two horses were luxuries, he declared. That is, supposing they did not strike a good claim before then. One day it would go up-stream, and the next day it would come back. Kinda off in the upper story, old Nelson was. âTrapped, you say. âOh, shore! Or you can stay, just as you please.â? Look here. he cried, picking up a fragment the size of an egg, and balancing it in his hands. âYeah. Well, letâs eat if itâs ready, Bud. I like this flat. he pointed out. âYeah. Well, Arizonaâs hard to excite. Cash pressed his lips together in a way that drove the color from there. âOh, yuh donât! he said again. That is, if this proves as good as it looks.â? You go ahead with your tests, Cash. âOf course,â? Awful good.â? He would like to find himself half owner of a mine worth about a million, he mused. And meet Marie, and her mother too, and let them get an eyeful. Still, she had gone of her own free will. No. Which was all very well, as far as it went. He watched the game. But Frank had already bought two tickets, and it seemed unfriendly to turn back now. He laughed at the one-reel comedy that had for its climax a chase of housemaids, policemen, and outraged fruit vendors after a well-meaning but unfortunate lover. Here was a love drama, three reels of it. Bud leaned forward, staring, his brows drawn together, breathing the short, quick breaths of emotion focussed upon one object, excluding all else. He wanted Marie. He wanted her more than he had ever wanted her in the old days, with a tenderness, an impulse to shield her from her own weaknesses, her own mistakes. He wanted to tell her so many things about the burros, and about the desertâ"things that would make her laugh, and things that would make her blink back the tears. I want a drink.â? he suggested. by now. headache, and laughed ruefully. âSame here,â? he said. Bud announced bluntly. âAw, I guess you ainât all that fatal, Bud. Letâs go over and have some breakfastâ"only itâll be dinner.â? âYou go, if you want to.â? He turned and looked down at Frank with a morose kind of pity. âYou go on and get your breakfast, kid. Upon Marie and the baby, to be exact. She might need it for the kid. âPretty good luck you had last night,â? He laughed recklessly, and got up. he grunted. Action, of a sort, they proceeded to get. But Frank was utterly, absolutely plastic. He laughed and drank when Bud suggested that they drink. He laughed and played whatever game Bud urged him into. He laughed and agreed with Bud when Bud made statements to test the credulity of anyman. He laughed and said, âSure. Letâs go!â? he said. he said. âYou are the derndest fool I ever run acrossâ"but at that youâre a good scout too,â? he informed Frank. âYou sober up now, like I said. he asked, as though that was the only matter worth discussing. âYeah. This is copper country, Bud. He turned and walked on beside Bud. âYeah. he said shortly. âYeah. he said resignedly. âAw, lay off that told-you-so stuff,â? âYou never figured anything of the kind, and you know it.â? Bud swore and went out, slamming the door behind him. âTry a cup of coffee straight,â? he said unemotionally, âand then lay down. Oh, well, what was the odds? He would like to know how she was getting alongâ"and the baby, too. She might think him a brute, and she might accuse him of failing to be a kind and loving husband; but she could not, unless Joe told of his spree, say that she had ever heard of his carousing around. He expected Marie to rave over them, whether she liked them or not. he began insidiously. âOh, no,â? âYes,â? But you seen it and backed up. And a good thing you did. âNo, I hadnât heard,â? âNo, I didnât know it,â? I run across him up in the mountains, a month or so ago. âYou working? âHe left some,â? As long as heâs in the State, you can make him dig up. âWhere did you see him, Joe?â? I could write up and find out for you.â? âOh, donât bother about it, Joe. Letâs forget him.â? âYou said it, Marie. Him she loved and gloried in. âNo, no, Lovin Child! he said, and rang up her fare and went off to the rear platform, just as if it were not a matter of life and death at all. She doubted it. Or, worse than that, what if she did not find him at all? She tried not to cry, but it seemed as though she must cry or scream. To distract him, she turned him around face to the window. Nor did its presence there trouble him in the least. He wanted to get back at the old hound somehowâ"without giving in an inch in the mute deadlock. Coffee, bacon, and hotcakes suited him perfectly. If it wasnât for that claim, heâd walk off and forget to come back. He would go to Alpine that day. He would hunt up Frank and see if he couldnât jar him into showing that he had a mind of his own. he demanded aggressively. He would chuck one under the chin, or feel diffidently the soft little cheek, but a closer familiarity scared him. âYou son of a gun!â? grinned Bud, in the tone that turned the epithet in to a caress. âYou dog gone little devil, you! then, if thatâs what you want.â? âNo, Iâll be doggoned if I will!â? he said. âYou canât tell about women, no time. She might spank the kid, or something. Heâll about bust, I reckon. Let him bust if he wants toâ"half the cabinâs mine, anyway.â? Here. âUgh, ugh, ugh,â? persisted Lovin Child, and pointed to the floor. âOh, well, they say itâs bad policy to take a bath right after yuh eat. he said, and set him down on the floor. Bud commanded Lovin Child gruffly. He wanted Marie, and he did not know how to make his want known to this big, tender, awkward man who had befriended him and filled his thoughts till bedtime. âAw, now, you donât wanta go and act like that. Listen here, Boy. Aw, looky!â? Bud wheedled. âYou can hold it if you want toâ"only donât drop it on the floorâ"here! You wanta freeze? He wanted Marie to take him and rock him to sleep, just as she had rocked him to sleep every night of his young memory, until that time when he had toddled out of her life and into a new and peculiar world that held no Marie. He wants his mother.â? cap. âGawd,â? Ee?â? âNo, no, no!â? âNo, no, no!â? Ee?â? âOh, I see, all right! Bud shouted, stubbing his toe as he hurried forward. âNow, doggone yuh, Iâm goinâ to stake you out, or hobble yuh, or some darn thing, till I get that wood in!â? he thundered, with his eyes laughing. âYou want to freeze? âYou doggone little devil!â? But,â? Darned if I wouldnât.â? If it were possible... Ee?â? to Cash, which was reward enough. he demanded. Consarn your little hide, Boy...â? Tried to keep his back to it. he grunted, âand then you can eat it if you want.â? he said, while he was feeding him oatmeal mush with sugar and canned milk. The weather did the rest. he began constrainedly, and waited. Bud tried again. âYeahâ"Iâm all right,â? Far from it. âShut up?â? Bud shouted above the din of Lovin Child. Here, you young imp, quit that, before I spank you! Hey, Boy! Not a sound came from under it. You sure have. They got to, or they wouldnât have no kids.â? âPretty sick kid, donât yuh think?â? Cash denied weakly, studying Lovin Child. âGive him here again, and you go fry them onions. You go back to bed, and Iâll lay him in with yuh. he asked glumly. he said reluctantly. âYeah. Still, he seems to feel all right.â? Never feazed him, either. âYeah. âYeah. âOh, Iâll find buttons. Me? Cash protested. âLemme tell yuh something, Bud. Me, or you?â? Bud exploded. âYeahâ"thatâs right! Bud retorted. âYou canât come around and grab the job Iâm doing.â? âYeah. Cash hinted strongly. he said drily. he retorted. âYeah. But you ought to put it in writing, Bud. âYeah. Share and share alike. âAw, git out!â? âYou ainât goinâ to horn in there, neither. âYeah. âYou know why you never reported him, doggone yuh! It ainât right, and it ainât honest. he said, with a huskiness in his voice, and pulled a tangle playfully. âYeah. When we parted, she took the kid with her. I was a drifter. But I want him to have the use of my name, understand. he said whimsically. âYeah. âYou said it all, that time. Then if he wants to change it when he grows up, he can.â? âYeah. I dunnoâ"Iâve got a couple of lots in Phoenix Iâll leave to the girl. But get this, and get it right. âYou donât have to beller at the top of your voice, do yuh?â? snapped Cash, prying the cork out of the ink bottle with his jackknife. âYou sign it, and then if you donât know just how to word yours, you can use this for a pattern. he said heavily. I want this baby, and I canât do without him. âTell a worlâ!â? âYeah. Cash will not,â? âTell a worlâ!â? âCan if he wants to. Here, you set down a minute, and let Bud take a peek up there.â? âYes, Bud pik-k.â? he cried excitedly. âYeah. And traces of washing here and there, too. The county buried him, they say. letâs weigh it out, Cash, and see how much it is, just for a josh.â? âYeahâ"well, I dunnoâs Iâd sell for that. âPretty good haul for a kid, anyway. Letâs see, Lovins. He would not give up the gold. âNo, no, no! Tell a worlâ no, no, no!â? Keep your gold, durn it. he said. I dunno, but it looks reasonable to me. Let him have a few nuggets if he wants. It ainât cold to-day, anyhow.â? Brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts did not count. Once she had started, she could not turn back. Come what might, she would hunt until she found him. Nor did she write to her. There, too, her great hurt had flung some of the blame. Bud least of all. suitâ"that, too, sounded like Lovin Child. âYou devil!â? âOh, you devil, you! Bud and Lovin Child. Upon this scene Marie came, still crying. Let goâ"heâs mine, I tell you. Come to Marie, boy baby!â? âTell a worlâ no, no, no!â? yelled Lovin Child, clinging to Cash. You let him go, or Iâllâ"Iâll kill you. Cash let go, but it was not because she commanded. Whyâ"why, father!â? Then suddenly he turned and ducked into the tunnel, after Bud. âLemme go.â? âYeah. Hold on a minute, Bud. Now, now, hold on! âYou go to hell,â? âNow, Bud, be calm!â? he adjured as he ran. You want to hold on to yourself, Bud, and be reasonable. âShut your damn mouth!â? Bud commanded him savagely, and went on running. âNow, Bud,â? âShut up, Cash. That, o course, lacked a little of being the exact truth. âNo, no, no!â? âTell a worlâ no, no!â? Bud retorted ecstatically, lifting his face again. Weâve got âem both for keeps, you and me.â? âYeahâ"I get it, all right.â?
