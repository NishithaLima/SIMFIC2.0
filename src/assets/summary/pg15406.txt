 corner. "Right you are. So it was now. "Thank you, I am not hurtâ"only rather shaken," she said in answer to the Candy Man. "Here's your bag," announced the long-legged child, fishing it out of the soggy mass of leaves beneath the wagon. She answered for herself. "Thank you, no; I am quite all rightâ"only muddy. She was tallish, but not very tall, and somewhat slight. His were laughing, and hers were instantly withdrawn. That was all until to-night. "Please do not put it in that way," he protested. "Aunt Eleanor," she added, "was needlessly alarmed. she asked, adding when he replied that this was the third time, that she thought he had rather an air of proprietorship. "Of course," Miss Bentley went on, "it must be a secret society, never mentioned in the papers, unknown to those you call its beneficiaries. "You might," said the Candy Man. "You understand." he said. "You are expecting a large bequest, then." It is only sad. I get interested in people," he added. "So do I," cried his companion. "And of course, you are right. "For your sick boy. You won't mind, as it isn't far. I have so enjoyed talking to you, Mr. McAllister. "Tim was Irish," she continued. she asked. The tree where the squirrel house is, you know." "What a funny name," she said. "Vol. I, what does that mean?" she asked, and without waiting for an answer she tossed it back to him, and ran to join the other pigeons. You are not laughing?" Cornelia is my mother, and she is a beauty. "Maimie was doing it up brown, but she lacks tact. I tried to stop her, but it was too late. "You are far too keen for a Candy Man," said the Reporter, laughing. Now I think of it, your Miss Bentley cannot be her niece. No, there was no mistaking her. She was not alone. She was looking at him and he was looking at her, and they were both laughing. "Oh, have you?" "Indeed I do," the Candy Man protested. "Yes, the lady who fell and got muddy. "Why, I guess so. I helped her, and by and by Uncle Bob came in." asked the Candy Man, just to keep her going. "It's a long name," said Virginia, "as long as mine. She laughed. "Oh, I forgot. Dr. And I must go now," Virginia finished. asked the Candy Man indiscreetly, forgetting himself for the moment. She was also the niece of Uncle Bob. "Yes," said Miss Bentley, "I liked him. She laughed at the recollection, clasping her hands behind her head. Of course he is not showy; perhaps he might be called a little slow; but he is substantial, and while I should be the last to place an undue emphasis upon wealth, one need not overlook its advantages. They are apt to be limited, in a way. Not always, of course, but often. It is very unlike him. "Perhaps it is," she said. "You will outgrow these socialistic ideas, my dear," she said. Mary's." There is, by the way, a difference between walking in Sunset Park, the abode of the elect, with a huge St. Bernard in leash, and taking the same exercise at River Bend, unchaperoned save by a chance guard. "I am glad you have come, Margaret Elizabeth," her aunt exclaimed. "How do you do, Miss Bentley. And so on, and so on. A dance was a dance, and Miss Bentley was young. She is so keen about everything." "Of course she's bound to get over that. Really, I am devoted to the boy." It is handsome, but I prefer simpler lines," Mrs. Pennington continued meditatively. "My dear, there is no need. You'll have to excuse me." She is a thoroughly nice, quite pretty girl, and that is all there is to it. "I am glad to see you," Margaret Elizabeth said, waking up. "Like a fairy-tale," she said. "The Candy Man wanted to know where you stayed when you weren't here," she remarked at length. "Why, you know the Candy Wagon on the Y.M.C.A. And a miser, you say?" "That is just what it isn't," she cried. "It must be fun to be a Candy Man," she continued. "It isn't much like a fairy-tale where I live. It is rather silly, you know." He knew who I was, for he called me Miss Bentley. He may have been somewhere about at the time, but I didn't meet him. "Certainly, he should have said at the very beginning, 'Miss Bentley, you are mistaken in thinking you know me.'" But she laughed herself. "Now, of course, Uncle Bob, this is strictly confidential. "Perhaps he forgot, too," he suggested. "All the same it was inexcusable in me," she declared sternly. "The nonsense I talked. You are almost certain to meet him again, andâ"â"" "I shall die if I do," Margaret Elizabeth declared; but somehow the assertion failed to ring true. "I believe she is taming the terrors," remarked the doctor. Good-by." he asked. You'll feel better," said Uncle Bob. she demanded, shaking out the shimmering folds before his surprised eyes. "Certainly. She is a genius. Thank you, Uncle Bob. "Never again will they throw a stone at his bunnyship. "You are a sort of philanthropist after all." "Yes, I have a very marked bump. She was now on her way to be gracious to the Candy Man, and in this connection she had rehearsed a neat little scene in which she stood by and allowed the children to make their purchases, and then at the right moment asked easily if there had been any more accidents on the corner of late, adding something about his kindness in helping her up, and so on. She was annoyed to the point of exasperation. The subject grew, as all subjects have a way of doing. "I know where there is a copy," said the youngest and wisest of the force, "but it won't do you any good. I have met him on two occasions when I was called in to attend his housekeeper, Mrs. Sampson, and he was courtesy itself. I will go with you and introduce you, if you like." She was assured she would find it stupid, but this was as nothing compared with the glory of entering the abode of the Miser in company with her ladyship, and the other pigeons looking enviously on outside. she wondered. He did not look it. Her hand was tired. "The Candy Man has one like this," she said. Only his is Vol. one and this is Vol. two." She was welcome to come when she chose, she was assured, with grave politeness. His library was at her disposal. "Never mind what he said. The mystery was, the Candy Man replied, how with such a face he could be a miser. "Oh, he's a bit nutty, of course. "Not on your tintype, my friend. asked the Candy Man. I have heard my grandmother mention it, but it was long before my day. "You are very kind," he said, adding as the Candy Man felt his pulse and nodded his satisfaction, "are you a physician?" "No," was the smiling answer. "Don't let me keep you," he added. "You are most kind." Your face is familiar, but my memory is at fault." corner. It may have been foolish. More enjoyment, I mean." I envied you. "You will not always be a Candy Man," he said. She is friendliness itself." "Quite," the Candy Man answered. I do not mean I am friendless, you understand. I have some school and college friends, good ones. I have been justly misunderstood." "It's Mr. Brown, isn't it?" "Of course, it must be hard work, but it must be interesting. "I like to talk to him, and do, every chance I get." Reynolds." "Thank you, Miss Bentley. he asked. "Thank you, I will sit here by the window." "Please sit down, Mr. Reynolds. "Of course you are aware that you allowed me to talk to you that morning in the park, in aâ"most unsuitable manner, without evenâ"â"" "How could I?" "I did not know." "Then you were disappointed in me," she added. he suggested. I know. cried Margaret Elizabeth. "I had seen you pass, I mean." "So I have been told." he asked mischievously. "Do not say that, please, Miss Bentley. I beg your pardon, and I am not laughing. She was overjoyed to see me, and poured out her troubles. said Miss Bentley. It will be new." "But Tim will soon be about again," said Margaret Elizabeth. "I met Tim the other day," she said. "You are absolutely untrustworthy, Uncle Bob. the doctor asked. I have met him once or twice." "I own you were right. "Never is a long day," said the Candy Man. "I am glad if you liked it," she replied. "It will do no harm to hope," she told him. After all, who was Mr. Reynolds? Yes, she did. But he wasn't. she asked him. "In fact never saw one." She laughed. "Oh, yes, you have. I have no doubt I have a lot of things you could help me to appreciate." General Waite, by the way," he informed her, "was own cousin to my grandmother on my mother's side. "Indeed!" said Margaret Elizabeth, politely. "It must have been thirty-five years ago. General Waite was a most courtly man, and his wife was quite famous for her beauty. She was worn to death herself, but she would recuperate, and surely her niece, who was years younger, could do the same. In fact, having brought matters to the present status, Mrs. Pennington allowed herself to relax. Of course I don't have to." said Margaret Elizabeth. "Thank you, Uncle Gerry," said Margaret Elizabeth. But you know in real life it is different." "Oh, did he?" said Miss Bentley. In fact Margaret Elizabeth was suffering from the irritability that so often accompanies convalescence. "I know it was a dreadful, dreadful thing to say." There it is, you see. I have thought about it, and thought about it, until I'm all mixed up." "She was very dignified. Then she walked away." "I had no chance. I will, of course." "Just slip it in my pocket, please." Of course not, it was an advertisement. She was thinking that she had seen just one little scrap of the Candy Man's writingâ"on the card accompanying the Christmas basket; and this on the letter was blurred and stained, yet she was sure of it. She was glad. She wanted him for a friend. She wanted to know more about him. "In fact I was not certain you cared to see me." I haven't read it. "It isn't worth reading now," he said. "Oh, did I? Honestly," asked Margaret Elizabeth. But you came." I haven't many friends; and besides, this is on the way to Texas." Her eyes came back and met his as they had done the day when the conversation turned upon fairy godmothers. "In fact, it is very serious. In fact, to be brief, I don't know who I am." Only a few of the passengers were saved, I among them." cried Margaret Elizabeth. "That is very strange," said Margaret Elizabeth. My mother, he thought from her speech, was English. asked Margaret Elizabeth. "Not much, it rather deepened the mystery. she demurred. "Somehow I am very sure," he answered. I have told you the worst, I wish you to know the best of me." "I trust you, Robert," it said. I choose it gladly, happily. Yours, Mary." cried Margaret Elizabeth, lifting a glowing face, "I love Mary." "She was brave and unselfish," said the Candy Man. "Yes, that is one side of it. 'Gladly, happily.'" Her eyes shone. "It must be so when you care very much," she went on. He did not mean to, but only to prepare the way. I have no business to be telling you so, but indeed I can't help it." That was all, but it was enough. He stood and looked after them. Far from it. I may say, to make an appeal to you. You are, I am sure, fond of Margaret Elizabeth." "I assure you, Mr. Vandegrift, I have her own word for it." he asked. Pardon me, but this is incredible." I cannot see him now," she begged tragically of Uncle Bob, who, honestly mystified now, stood between her and the door, looking from it to her. And oh, what is the matter? I cannot see him." "Certainly it is I. "Don't be silly, please, I have had a most trying day. "I am sorry, you know I am, that I can't do as she wishes, but you understand that I can't. cried Mrs. Pennington. cried Margaret Elizabeth, in her turn aghast. Deane was Rob's middle name, so naturally it led to an investigation." he asked. "Oh, yes. I want to be on speaking terms with both ends, you see." I was struck with the resemblance, myself." She rose. "Really we must be going," she said. "Of course," she heard herself saying, "it was a disappointment to me, but romantic girls are not to be controlled by common-sense aunts, and really it might be worse." I liked him. I rather liked defying common sense," said Margaret Elizabeth. "Of course you are right," she agreed. I have to take the money, there is no way out of it. asked Margaret Elizabeth. "To adopt me. "Exactly. It is honestly his." "We must make it up to him in some way," said Margaret Elizabeth. We can build a house," responded the Candy Man. And I'll tell you what, speaking of the Miser. "So do I," said the Candy Man. "Oh, I am sure we can work it out," cried Margaret Elizabeth. "I am sure we can," he assented. "You aren't disturbing. "Indeed we do," she answered. For instance now, there may be heirs." "Here's the address," she said. he asked. Then she said, slipping her hand into his, "One other."
