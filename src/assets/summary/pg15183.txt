 There are times when it is crowded, and there is even a difficulty in making room for all who come. No wonder the elite of Brighton like the West Pier; it is one of the most enjoyable spots in England; every luxury and comfort is there; a good library, plenty of newspapers, elegant little shops, excellent refreshment rooms, fine music; and then the lovely blue, dimpling sea, the little boats with their white sails, like white-winged birds on the water, the grand stretch of the waves, the blue sky overhead, and the town, with its fine, tall houses shining in the sunlight, the line of white cliff and the beach where the children are at play. It is a famous place, not for love-making but for flirtation; a famous place for studying human nature; a famous place for passing a pleasant hour. Do not believe them, for you will hear the murmur of two voices, and the theme is always "love." It was the end of September, and the only peculiarity of the month that I remember was this: the nights grew dark very soonâ"they were not cold; the darkness was rather that of soft thick gloom that spread over land and sea. I tried the Aquarium. I gave myself up to my dreams. She was closely veiled, so that I could not see her face. It was a dramatic scene: the dark, heaving sea, with the fitful gleam of the moonlight; the silent pier, with the one huge light; the tall, dark figure standing there so motionless. She stood for some minutes in silence; then I heard again bitter weeping, passionate sobs, long-drawn sighs. I repeat this most emphatically, as I should not like any suspicion of indolence or indifference to rest upon me. Quite a quarter of an hour passed, and she did not stir. I can see it now, and I shall see it until I die. she cried. I looked down. "What is the matter?" I asked. "Matter, sir?" I was on the point of saying that it was quite impossible, for I had been on the Chain Pier last night, and had seen nothing of the kind. "May be; but I am not sure. "What is it?" I asked. "Tell me about it," I said. It was tight on the hooks, and he had to tear the shawl to get it off. It is true, sir, and murder will out." I asked. I asked. "Just there," he said. Oh, Heaven, the pathos of it! It was a woman who killed Joelâ"a woman who slew Holofernesâ"but the woman who drowned this little, tiny child was more cruel by far than they. I bent forward. if I had doubted before, I could doubt no longer. Mother and child, I knew and felt sure. she said; "how I should like to take those wet things off, and make it warm by a good fire!" "There is but little chance when a child has lain all night in the sea." she asked. "You are very good, sir," said the superintendent, and the pitiful woman cried out: "Heaven bless you, sir! "There must be an inquest," said some one in the crowd; "we ought to know whether the child was dead before it was thrown into the water." "I am sure," she said, "that the child was alive when it touched the water." "Look at the face, sir, and you will see." "I do," she said. I see the signs of faint, baby surprise. It was living when it touched the water, I am sure of that." not rare. It is a wide step from the warmth of a mother's arms to the chill of the deep-sea water. Jim, the boatman, proved the finding of it. "I will call it 'Marah,'" I said, and the name stands there on the marble cross: "Marah, aged three weeks. Found drowned in the sea, September, 18â"." It was soon all forgotten, but I never forgot the beautiful, despairing face I had seen on the pier that nightâ"the face that seemed to have passed me with the quickness of a swift wind, yet which was impressed on my brain forever. Lance Fleming had been brought up to the bar, but he never cared much for his profession, and was much pleased when he succeeded to his cousin's estate. No wonder that he was popular. "If you marry the right woman, Lance," I said to him, "you will be one of the happiest and most successful men in the world; but if you should make a mistake, you will be one of the most miserable." I said. "No," I replied. Lance Fleming was married. Of course, she was perfectionâ"nay, just a little beyond perfection, I think. She was beautiful, clever, accomplished, and such a darlingâ"of course, I might be sure of that. I love to hear the gentle sound of her voice, sweet and low as the sound of a luteâ"the frou-frou of her dress as she moves about. Found drowned." "There is no fear, John," he replied; "my Frances would be an antidote against all the serpents in the world. It was perfect, so were the horses, so was the groom in his neat livery, so was the dogcart waiting for the luggage, so was the magnificent retriever that ran with the carriage. I am a very fortunate man, John." "You are indeed," I replied. "Famous ivy," said Lance. "I do not wonder at it," I said. "You do not seem to care for Lady Ledbitter," I said to him. "I wish you would stay and never leave us; I am happy enough in having Frances; if I had you as well, my happiness would be complete. said Lance. I envied him. "I wish you would forget all about her, John. She was not worthy of you." he said. "If one fails, try another." "If your Frances died, should you love another woman?" I asked. "That is quite another thing," he said, and I saw in his heart he resented the fact that I should place the woman who had been faithless to me on an equality with his wife. It was she as surely as heaven shone above us. It was only the sight of Lance's face that deterred me. "What is the matter, John?" asked Lance, impatiently. Lance laughed aloud. You must deal gently with him, Frances," he said to his wife; "his nerves are weakâ"he cannot bear much at a time." We must take great care of him." "That we will," was the hearty reply. Lance looked at us most ruefully, so that she laughed and said: "Come with us, Lance." It was the face of a good womanâ"there was nothing cruel, nothing subtle in it. She was a perfect hostessâ"most attentiveâ"most graceful. "You will laugh at the notion of a fire in May," she said; "but I find the early summer evenings chilly, and I cannot bear the cold." I looked at her; there was not even a fleeting shadow on her face. I love my husband so utterly, so entirely, that all whom he loves are dear to me. a murderess, if ever there was one! "You do not care for hasty friends," she said. "You are more than good to me," I stammered, thinking in my heart if she had been but half as good to the little helpless child she flung into the sea. "Now for a test," I said to myself. I looked at her straight in the face, so that no expression of hers could escape meâ"no shadow pass over her eyes unknown to me. I asked her. She smiled as she replied: "I do not. "I spent a few hours there once," she said. Mr. Ford, will you join me?" I was obliged to own that she did. What, under those circumstances, was any man to do? Fleming?" I asked. "Yes," she replied, laconically. I asked again. "My wife is as strong in her dislikes as in her likes," he said. I repeated. "That is not the effect the sea has upon most people," I said. "No, I suppose not; it has upon me," she answered. I meant nothing by the words, but a shifting, curious look came into her face, and for the first time since I had been there her eyes fell before mine. She watched me curiously, and I knew it. she asked. And, after all, yours is but a fancy, Frances." asked Lance, indifferently. "So do the Northern seas," he replied. I love the country; you love the sea. "That is not fair, Frances," cried Lance. "And of mystery," I interrupted. "Yes, of mystery!" I said. In some parts it was very shallow, in some very deep. I asked. I said, as I returned it to her. "She died when I was a child." "Almost," she replied, briefly. I said. "Hardly," I said. "Not one happy hour," she said. I was one of them. Do I tire you, Mr. "On the contrary, I am deeply interested," I replied. I said. "Yes, so much the worse for me." she asked. "It should not be so," she said. She was startled again, I saw it in her face. asked Lance, looking up eagerly from his paper. "Mine," she repliedâ""this." he asked. "Yes," she replied, opening it and holding it out for him to see. he said, "Excepting me, that is all you have in the world." "How lovely you were when I found you, Frances," he said. "You are only jesting," she said. It was a pretty sight to see her go into those poor, little, dirty houses. she asked of her husband. "And you, Mr. she said. Ah, Heaven! she asked, in her sweet, compassionate voice. "I do not know," she said; "I do not understand such things." But I knew. I mentioned no names, but I told him the story. A few more days passed. Lance looked suddenly from his paper. I asked. Lance laughed aloud. She was deadly pale, her hand shaking. Then Lance continued, "You interrupted me, Frances. "It wants some speaking about," said Lance. It is a blot on the face of the land." "I do not suppose that any decree of Government would change it," I said; "the evil lies too deeply for that; the law should be made equal; as it is, the whole blame, shame and punishment fall on the woman, while the man goes free; there will be no change for the better while that is the case. "You are right, John," said my old friend. "You will talk of such horrible things," she replied, vehemently, "and you know that I cannot bear them." You must forgive me, Frances, but to me there is something far more loathing in the woman who kills a child than in the woman who slays a man. Do not look so pale and grieved, my darling! John, we must be more careful what we say." Fleming?" I asked. She lingered a few minutes, then went out. "This is my last purchase," he said. asked Lance. I promised to do so, and then I knew the time for speaking to her had come. she asked me. I asked. "Yes, by all means," she replied. "I am sure the subject is very grave, you look so unhappy." "I will tell you of what I am thinking, Mrs. Fleming," I said; "but I must tell it to you as a story." "There were two friends once upon a time," I began, "who loved each other with a love deeper and truer than the love of brothers." I dare not look at her. "Then she walked to the side of the pier. "There was a faint splash in the water," I went on; "it was all over in less than a second, and then the swift waves rolled on as before. Oh, Heaven, be pitiful to all who are stricken and guilty! Now comes the horror, Mrs. Fleming. I asked. Fleming?" I asked. "I knew it must come," she wailed. I said. If I deny it, then the very stones in the street will cry it out. I asked. "Noâ"not at all," was the half sullen replyâ""not at all." "No," she replied. she asked, and I saw her looking at them in wonder. "I knew it must come," she said. "Now, let me try to think what I must do. Oh, Lance! my love, Lance! my love, Lance! she cried, turning to me with impassioned appeal. "You will not!â"you could not break his heart and mine!â"you could not kill me! "â""her love, Lance!" "Marah, found drowned." she moaned. "How good you are, but you will not tell him. "You were that, indeed," I replied. "The child you flung into the sea was living, not dead." "Oh, no, a thousand times!" she cried. "You had better tell Lance, not me," I cried. wretched, miserable me, I was in Heaven. I met him in the early morning, I met him in the gloaming. We must wait until then. "There was no hope, no chance. I asked. "'No, certainly not; and you know that I never did. It was a Summer's amusement.' I asked. "'Oh, you must make the best of it. Of course, I will not see you want, but you must not annoy me. You must do the best you can. She was only three weeks old when a letter was forwarded to me at the address I had given in London, saying that my grandmother was ill and wished me to go home at once. I meant to work hard to keep her in a nice home. I asked the kindly landlady. I asked, and she told me. I asked again, and she laughed. "'No,' she replied, 'certainly not. I meant to be so. 'It is dying, I am sure.' "You see, that if my little one died by my fault, it was most unconscious on my part; it was most innocently, most ignorantly done. It was coldâ"oh, my Heaven, how cold!â"lifeless; no breath passed the little lips! It was mad and wicked I know now; I can see how horrible it was; it did not seem to be so then. Oh, Heaven! "You will spare me," she went on. "You see I did no one any harm, wrong or injury. "I will think about it," I replied. "But I cannot live in this suspense," she cried. "If you will tell him, tell him this day, this hour." "He might forgive you," I said. I suggested. "Oh, no!" she cried, with a shudder. "No, I shall never tell him." "I do not say that I shall," I said. "There is my husband," she said. "Do I look very ill, Mr. "You do, indeed; you look ghastly," I said. "I will go and meet him," she said. "That is it," she replied. he asked. She was not a murderess, as I had believed her to be. It was in the middle of a bright, sunshiny afternoon when they returned. I asked. "Yes, it aches very much," she replied. She stood up. "What is it, Lance?" I asked. I looked at him in horror. "I am quite sure," he replied. It was a bad case. It was soon over. "She will die," he said, hoarsely. "Most certainly," I replied. She smiled when she saw me, and beckoned me to her. Ah, poor soul! I promised, and she died!
