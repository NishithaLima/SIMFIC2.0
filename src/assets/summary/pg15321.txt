 'BREVOORT HOUSE, NEW YORK, Oct. 6th, 18â". Frank Tracy, of Tracy Park, in the quiet town of Shannondale, where our story opens. Hysterics of course, if not a sick headache. I don't believe I can face her till she has had a little time to get over it. Here, boy, I want, you!' 'Thank you, but I don't care for the money,' the boy said 'I was going to the park anyway to tell Mrs. Tracy that grandma is sick and can't go there to-night.' 'Now, hurry off with the telegram, and mind you don't lose it. 'Mr. Oh, I am so glad!' He's seen 'em, they say.' 'No; Arthur will never be so mean,' he said. Besides that, he will want somebody to keep his house for him, unlessâ"' and here the perspiration started from every pore, as Frank Tracy thought: 'What if he is married, and the us in his telegram means a wife, instead of a friend or servant, as I imagined!' Think of my fastidious brother shaking hands with him and Widow Shipley, who kept a low tavern on the tow-path! They were so poor, she and Frank, and they wanted so many things, and the man who could have helped them was dead and had left them nothing. We are going to Europe; shall sail to-morrow morning at nine o'clock in the Scotia. 'Yours lovingly, 'Amy Crawford, now, but when you read this, 'Amy Hastings.' But it was too late now. Mrs. Crawford heard him say, as she approached the open door. We were to start by this time, and he in bed yet!' Mrs. Crawford asked, as she stepped into the room. They are to be married this morning, and sail in the Scotia for Europe.' Both of them. 'You have not told me all. I, who, he said, might marry the greatest lady in the land. I could have knocked him down for his sneer at Amy, and I wish now I had, the wretch! He will not marry your daughter, madam; and if he does not I will kill him!' 'Mrs. Crawford:â"I am off for Europe to-morrow, and when I shall return is a matter of uncertainty. They are married; or at least I suppose so, for I found a list of the passengers who sailed in the Scotia, and the names, Mr. and Mrs. Hastings, were in it. I loved her so much, and I love her still as I can never love another woman, and I could have made her so happy; but that is past, and I can only watch her at a distance. When I have anything to communicate, I will write again. 'Yours truly, 'Arthur Tracy.' When I want money I shall call upon Colvin. 'I shall never marry, and when I die, what I have will naturally go to you. There are marble basins, with silver chains and stoppers, at Tracy Pack, and you can have a hot bath every day if you like, in a room which would not shame Caracalla himself. And I know you will like it all, and Dolly, too; but don't make fools of yourselves. They are the true gentlemen, and were to the manner born. Mrs. Frank was always inquiring for and expecting news, but she was not prepared for what this day brought her. We are going there to live, and you will be as grand a lady as Mrs. Atherton, of Brier Hill; or that young girl at Collingwood.' Was he crazy, or what? 'Not a bit of it,' he replied, recovering himself and beginning to realize the good fortune which had come to him. 'But we shall enjoy it all the same, and hold our heads with the best of them. Besides, don't you see, Arthur gives me carte blanche as to pay for my services, and, though I shall do right, it is not in human nature that I should not feather my nest when I have a chance. Give me the good old-fashioned way, I say, with peas and potatoes, and meat, and things, and cups that will hold half a pint and have some thickness that you can feel in your mouth.' Mrs. Frank, as the more democratic of the two, decided that it was. There are the Tracys, our new neighbors.' On the occasion of Mrs. Frank's first and only visit to her brother-in-law it was winter, and everything was covered with snow. But it was summer now, the month of roses, and fragrance, and beauty, and as the carriage passed up the broad, smooth avenue which led to the house, Dolly's eyes wandered over the well-kept lawn, sweet with the scent of newly-mown grass, the parteries of flowers and shrubs, the winding walks and clumps of evergreens here and there formed into fancy rooms, with rustic seats and tables under the over-hanging boughs; and when she reflected that all this was hers to enjoy for many years, and perhaps for her life-time, she felt the first stirring of that pride, and satisfaction, and self-assertion which was to grow upon her so rapidly and transform her from the plain, unpretentious woman who had washed, and ironed, and baked, and mended in the small house in Langley into the arrogant, haughty lady of fashion, who courted only the rich and looked down upon her less fortunate neighbors. They were civil, and the house was in perfect order, and so much larger and handsomer than she had thought it to be, that she felt bewildered and embarrassed, and said 'Yes 'em,' and 'No, ma'am,' to Martha, the cook, and told Sarah, who was waiting at dinner, that she 'might as well sit down in a chair as to stand all the time; she presumed she was tired with so many extra steps to take.' 'Some peddler or agent, I dare say. Why couldn't he come round to the kitchen, door, I'd like to know?' They are the plague of my life, and think I'll buy everything and give to everything because Arthur did. I am doing my own work, you see. But if the belief that the love she once refused and which she would fain recover was lost to her forever rankled in her breast, Grace never made a sign, and laughed as gayly and looked almost as young and handsome as in the days when Richard was wooing her in the pleasant old English town across the sea. Mrs. Tracy colored scarlet, and for a moment was silent. Try her, and do not make a servant of yourself. 'You have no business to be digging round like a slave when we are able to have what we like. I am going in for a good time, and don't mean to work either. 'But it takes so long, and I have much to see to in this great house,' Dolly objected, and her husband replied: 'Get another girl, then; three of them if you like. He said so in his letter. I've told you so a hundred times, and now there is no need of saving. I want to see you a lady of silks and satins like Mrs. Atherton. That, from her nature, she could not and would not do. Mrs. Crawford was very proud, but she was poor, too, and as the price per week which Frank offered her was four times as much as she could earn by sewing, she consented at last and went as nurse to the sick-room, and the baby, Tom, on whose little red face she imprinted many a kiss for the sake of her daughter who was coming home in June, and over whom the shadow of hope and fear was hanging. Frank Tracy had at first grown faster than his wife, and the change in his manner had been more perceptible; for with all her foolishness Dolly had a kind heart, and a keen sense of right, and wrong, and justice than her husband. They were to have music, and flowers, and a caterer from Springfield, where a lovely party-dress for herself of peach-blow satin was making, and nothing occurred of any importance to disturb her until the morning of the day appointed for the party, when it seemed as if every evil culminated at once. She thinks, perhaps, you can get Mrs. Mosher.' Mrs. Tracy said this so sharply that a flush mounted to the handsome face of the boy, who felt as if he were in some way a culprit and being reprimanded. 'I'd like it first-rate,' Harold said, his face brightening at the thought of earning fifty cents and seeing the show at the same time. 'What is it?' Mrs. Tracy asked, as she detected in him a disposition to reconsider. 'Of course not,' Mrs. Tracy replied. 'Mr. Tracy said I was to bring you this. It's from Mr. Arthur, and he's coming to-night. I'm so glad, and grandma will be, too!' I thought you had gone!' 'Of course not. she asked, questioningly, and a little less sharply. 'Thank you; I have my meetin' clothes, and do not want Tom's,' was Harold's reply, as he walked away, thinking he would go in rags before he would wear anything which belonged to his enemy, Tom Tracy. 'Well, Dolly,' he said, the moment they were alone, 'this is awfully unlucky, the whole business. He said in his telegram, "Send to meet us." Oh, Frank!' When I come back we will go into the country, where you can have a garden, with flowers and chickens, and grow fat and pretty again. Good-bye.' She never saw him again, and only heard from him once. 'But we are sure to find him again,' he said, encouragingly; 'and meantime I shall see that you do not suffer. But it was Mrs. Crawford who opened it and read that Harold Hastings was dead: that Amy was free, and that Arthur Tracy, who through all had loved her just as well as when he first asked her to be his wife, now put the question again, offering to make her the mistress of Tracy Park and surround her with every possible comfort. 'Say yes, darling Amy,' he wrote, 'and we may yet be very happy. I'm to stay in the upper hall and tell 'em where to go.' 'Oh, I am so glad, so glad.' 'What they do, and what they say, and what they wear, and if I can, I'll speak to Mr. Arthur Tracy and thank him for mother's grave-stone.' 'Old Peterkin, of course. Come to me this minute! And you, boy, go to the kitchen; or, noâ"now you are here, come up stairs, and I'll tell you what you are to do.' We are going to run you in, you bet!' They are Mrs. Peterkin's. With the quick instinct of a bright, intelligent boy, he decided who was accustomed to society and who was not, and leaning over the banister when not on duty, watched them when they entered the drawing-room and were received by Mr. and Mrs. Tracy. Walk in. Handsomer than anybody yet, and different, too, somehow.' Why don't you bring a chair from one of the rooms and sit when you can?' But, alas, for poor Harold! 'Yes, we were friends,' the latter replied; 'but when he lived here my health was such that I did not mingle much in society. Frank saw the faint smile of contempt which showed itself in Squire Harrington's face, and his own grew red with shame, but paled almost instantly as the outer door was opened by some one who did not seem to think it necessary to ring; and a stranger, in Spanish cloak and broad-brimmed hat, stepped into the hall. was the not very cordial response. 'Mr. Frank Tracy sent me from the park to fetch you,' John replied. Are you alone?' 'Yes, probably that is it,' Mr. Tracy said, more cheerfully, 'she was asleep and carried by. He is here. We are having a great break-down to-night.' was John's reply. 'Oh, a party!' 'Well, I will be a guest, too. Frank is going to Congress, is he? I did not hear the carriage, though I was listening for it. Are you not well?' 'I'd like a bath in ice water,' he said, as he began drying himself with a fresh towel. 'No, you will have to excuse me,' Arthur replied. Frank stammered, while the cold sweat began to run down his back. 'Yes, but somebody is coming to-morrow; I do not know who; Gretchen, he calls her,' was Frank's reply. Mrs. Tracy repeated, in a trembling voice. Don't they know what horrid discord they are making? 'Telling the folks which way to go,' was Harold's answer. 'What is your name?' 'No, you never will do it again. 'What is it? Frank said. aâ"gol darn it, what is it?' 'Wall, yes; I s'pose that's it, though 'taint exactly what I was trying to think of,' he said. I don't forgit that he used to speak to me civil when I was nobody, and now, though I'm a Dimocrat, as everybody knows me knows, and everybody most does know me, for Shannondale allus was my native town, I'm goin' to run him into Congress, if it takes my bottom dollar, and anybody, Republican or Dimocrat; who don't vote him ain't my friend, and must expect to feel the full heft of myâ"myâ"' 'Powerful disapprobation,' Arthur said, softly, and Peterkin continued: 'Thank you, sir, that's the wordâ"powerful, sir, powerful, powerful,' and he glowered threateningly at two or three young men in white kids and high shirt collars, who were known to prefer the opposing candidate. 'No,' Peterkin said, with a shake of the head. Mrs. Tracy was at once summoned to the scene, and the missing wraps were found in the ladies' room, where Harold had carried them, but the gold-headed shawl-pin was gone and could not be found. 'All right,' was Frank's reply. Am sorry I disturbed you.' On the next train, may be,' was John's reply, at which Arthur caught eagerly. 'Yes, the next train, most likely. We must go and meet her,' was Arthur's reply, as he passed up the stairs, while Frank and his wife looked wonderingly at each other. It you do, I willâ"' 'Nonsense!' I was sick all that time when you heard from me so seldom, and I am not strong yet. I need quite a rest. I am going to take the three south rooms on the second floor for my own. But I am going to atone, and this suite of rooms is for her. I sent them to her when I wrote to her to join me in Liverpool.' Frank said, determined by adroit questioning to learn something of the mysterious Gretchen. 'Not a minute. Frank said. 'Yes, with me at Brevoort.' 'And you left her there?' Diamond were the jewels of all others which she coveted, but which Frank never felt warranted in buying, and now they were hers, and for a time she forgot even Gretchen, whose arrival, or rather non-arrival, troubled her as much as it did her brother-in-law. Do you understand?' 'But I shall,' Peterkin roared. 'I'll have the young dog arrested, too, if he don't own up and give up.' Will you please explain?' When I called the brat a thief and said I'd have him arrested, she made for the door and ordered me outâ"me, Joe Peterkin, of the 'Liza Ann! If it were not for soiling my hands, I would throw you down the steps,' he continued, as he stood holding the door open, and looking with his flashing eyes and dilated nostrils, as if he were fully equal to anything. Please tell John to have the carriage ready. I am going myself this time.' 'Of course he is crazy, and ought to be taken care of before he tears the house down over our heads, or does some dreadful thing.' 'Keep him at home, if possible. My wife does the same. 'No, she will never come. As soon as I came out I was better, though I was not quite myself till I got to Liverpool. Stand by me, St. Claire. I can see I am in the way, and Frank would like to be rid of me; but stand by me, and don't let them do it.' 'But I would not come for Gretchen any more,' he said. You know he is crazy, and so do I, and I'll swear to it on a stack of Bibles as high as the house.' But molest me, and I shall molest you. Good morning, gentlemen!' But it was this going elsewhere which Frank did not fancy; and, after a consultation with his wife, he decided to let matters take their course for a time at least, or until Gretchen came, if she ever did. Will you never come?' was often asked, but the answer was always the same: 'She is Gretchen. But if he were expecting her, he no longer asked that the carriage be sent to meet her. 'Yes, to Gretchen?' Frank said, quickly, as he advanced nearer to the writing desk, hoping to see the address on the envelope. And this was all the intercourse he held with Mrs. Crawford, except to send her at Christmas a hundred dollars, which he said was for the boy Harold, to whom he had done an injustice. On the whole, however, he was very quiet and undemonstrative, and but for the habit of talking to himself and smelling odors where there were none, he would not have seemed very different from many peculiar people who are never suspected of being crazy. Not fur, I hope, such a night as this. We are almost there,' and putting down the child, she tugged with all her strength at the ponderous gate, which she at last succeeded in opening, and resuming her burden, passed through into the field where the snow lay on the ground in great white drifts, while the blinding flakes and cutting sleet from the leaden clouds above, beat pitilessly upon her as she struggled on the wearisome way. They were surely holding carnival to-night, and their king was out with all his legions, and as Arthur listened to the roar of the tempest he whispered to himself: 'A wild, wild night for Gretchen to arrive, and her dear little feet and hands will be so cold; but there is warmth and comfort here, and love such as she never dreamed of, poor Gretchen! It must be almost time,' and he glanced at a small cathedral clock which stood upon the mantel. And you will send for her. 'Oh, Frank,' Arthur exclaimed, his face brightening at once, 'you have made me so happy! 'All right; all right. And s'posin' she does come, she can find somebody to fetch her. It must be time.' 'I shall have to tell Arthur,' he thought, and, with something like hesitancy, he started for his brother's room. I did not see the carriage. 'No, she has not come. Oh, Frank! 'No, no; let me cry,' Arthur replied. Oh, Gretchen, my love, my love!' Yes, Gretchen, I am coming!' But it did not come again, though Frank, whose nerves were strung to almost as high a tension as his brother's, thought he heard it once above the roar of the tempest, and a vague feeling of disquiet took possession of him as he sat for an hour longer watching his brother and listening to the noise without. 'Oh, the tramps sleep here, do they?' 'Well, let them. 'Not a bad idea either,' Harold said, as he comprehended the situation; 'and your poor mother gave you the most of her cloak, too, and her shawl,' he continued, as he saw how carefully the child had been wrapped, while the mother, if it were her mother, had paid for her unselfishness with her life. 'What is your name, little girl?' I was not afraid with the baby there, but it is so awful, and I never saw any one dead before.' 'But you must go to the park at once and tell them; go as fast as you can. Are you going to faint?' Was she young? Was she pretty? Was she dark or fair?' We must go to the Tramp House after the woman, and send to the village for a doctor, and telegraph to Springfield for the coroner. 'Oh, Frank, must it come here? 'I tell you that woman must come here,' was Frank's decided reply, as he began to make himself ready for the ride. Oh, what's this?' 'What time was that, do you think?' 'Yes, there is something moreâ"her trunk,' chimed in the baggage-master, who had just entered the room, trembling and breathless. I spoke to her, but she did not answer, and snatching up the child, she hurried off, almost on a run. On the margin opposite this verse was written, in a girlish hand: 'Think of me as there when you read this, and do not be sorry.' You do not think this woman is she?' No. Don't be a fool, Dolly. No, indeed!' Oh, Frank, who is she? 'We do not know who she is, or where she came from!' Frank replied, 'Mr. Why should I see her, and shock my nerves more than they are already shocked?' 'But you must see her,' Frank continued. She came last night. Not by train, for John was there. Tell me the truth. 'No,' Frank answered huskily. No, Gretchen has no child. Will you see her now?' 'Forgive me, Arthur, I did not send him as you thought. His mood had passed, and Frank did not hear him now. You know I told you there was a little girl found with her. Frank said. 'No, no!' 'Let her stay where she is, I don't like children as a rule. You know I can't abide the noise yours sometimes make.' Do it yourself, and send the bill to me. On the whole, I do not believe she was. With these specious arguments Frank tried to quiet his conscience, but he could not help feeling that Satan had possession of him, and as he hurried through the hall he said aloud, as if speaking to something seen: 'Go awayâ"go away! The coroner will be here, too. Mrs. Tracy passed the allusion to the coroner in silence, but of the little girl she said: 'I suppose the child must come to the funeral, but you surely do not mean to keep her? We are not bound to do that because her mother froze to death on our premises.' 'Would you let her go to the poor-house?' Mrs. Crawford had had a busy and exciting day with her charge, who, active and restless, and playful, kept her on the alert and made her forget in part how lame she was. Claire.' 'Of course it is baby's, then,' Harold replied; 'but, I shall call her Jerry for short, even if it is a boy's name, and so my little lady, I christen you Jerry;' and kissing the forehead, the eyes, the nose, and the chin, he marked the shape of the cross upon the face upturned to his, and named his baby 'Jerry.' 'Yahâ"ouiâ"'ess,' was the answer, and there was a gleam of triumph in the blue eyes which flashed up to Harold for approbation. 'Yahâ"'ess,' was the reply. 'No, Dolly!' Oh, Frank! 'Acts as if she belonged here, doesn't she?' Frank said to his wife, who did not reply, so intent was she upon watching the strange child, who deliberately took off her cloak and hood and tossing them upon the floor, drew a small low chair to the fire, and climbing into it, sat down as composedly as if she were mistress there instead of an intruder. 'Hallo, what's up?' I hope, Miss Howard, you will see that she does not go near the children.' 'Catty as well as pretty,' Tom said. 'Mother said so,' Tom replied. Where would she go if she did not go to the poor-house? 'I shall take care of her. 'It's a lie, Tom Tracy,' Harold said. 'Mr. We do it ourselves, and have for ever so long. Whose house is this, I'd like to know? It isn't yours, nor your father's, and there isn't a thing in it yours. 'Wall, we are to be his haresâ"Jack, and Maude, and me. Let the Tracys bury their own dead, I say!' I don't say nothin', nor insinerate nothin', but I won't consent to have the town pay what belongs to the Tracys. 'I shall be glad when she is buried. Go and see, and send her away.' I can see it clearer now, how I left her and did not write, and I don't know where she is, or if she will ever come; and yet, I feel as if she had come, or tidings of her. And this woman might be one of them; indeed, Peterkin had said that she was, and they came in crowds to see her, and to see, as well, the inside of the handsome house, of which they had heard so much, especially since Mr. Arthur's return. Give me this one, and send the bill to me, not to Arthur.' Jerry was asleep at last, but she sobbed occasionally in her sleep, and there were great tears on her eyelashes, while her fingers clutched Frank's hand tightly as if fearing to let it go. 'Well, lock every door leading up this way, and shut out the gossipping blockheads who will come by hundreds, and, if we would let them, swarm into my room as thick as the frogs were in the houses of the Egyptians. Shut the doors, Charles, and keep them out.' I am going to get up and see the last of this poor woman. God help her, whoever she was.' 'Thank Heaven it is over and the rabble gone,' he said, when he became easier. Wheel me out there, Charles, where I can see her.' Frank Tracy's face was very pale and stern as he held little Jerry in his arms during the committal of the body to the grave, and then bade her take one last look at the box which held her mother. 'Yes, grandmaâ"say yes!' Mrs. Crawford had never seen him so interested in anything and felt somewhat surprised and puzzled, but she expressed her willingness to take the child and do what she could for her. 'It will be a good thing for Harold,' she said, 'as he is in danger of growing selfish here alone with me.' I don't understand it myself.' 'Certainly not,' he seemed to hear in reply, either from within or without, he hardly knew which, and he went on: 'I shall try to find out who the woman was, and where she came from; but how am I to do it? 'Nothing,' was the consoling reply; and as the sleigh just then drew up before his door, Frank alighted from it, and said to himself as he ran up the steps: 'I believe I have been riding with the devil, and have made a league with him!' Will you give up your prospects for a photograph and a likeness which may be accidental?' 'Jerry,' he said, 'that lady who just died in the bed with the cap on was your mamma, was it not?' ''Ess,' was Jerry's reply, for she still adhered to her first pronunciation of the word. ''Ess,' Jerry said again; 'Mah-nee.' Was he there with you?' Was it in Wiesbaden?' 'Of course your mother died in the Tramp House, and I have nothing with which to reproach myself. But if Jerry had not visited it in person, she was greatly interested in the handsome house and grounds, and the lovely rooms where the crazy man lived. He said it again, and over the child's face there came a puzzled expression, as if she were trying to recall something which baffled all her efforts. Detchen, Detchen, where are you?' Jerry had seen Maude Tracy many times and had admired her greatly, with her pretty white dresses and costly embroideries; and once, at church, when Maude passed near where she was standing, she stood back as far as possible out of the way and held her plain gingham dress aside, as if neither it nor herself had any right to come in close contact with so superior a being. To tell the truth, our little Jerry was rather vain. Jerry asked, and he replied: 'Oh, I suppose they feel big because they are rich and we are poor.' Why don't I live at the park like Maude, and wear low-necked aprons instead of this old high one?' Jerry asked; but Harold could not tell, and only said: 'Would you rather live at the park than with me?' 'No,' Jerry answered, promptly, stopping short and digging her heel into the soft loam of the path. 'But I have Harold and a grandma, and you hain't,' and running up to Harold, she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him lovingly, as if to make amends for the momentary repining. 'Oh, isn't it grand, Harold?' she asked, and Harold replied: 'I don't know. 'Jerry, Jerry! Crazyman, Mr. Crazyman, don't you want some cherries?' Crazyman! Crazyman! Take me in, won't you?' 'Pshaw, he won't hurt her. Jerry asked at last. 'Yes. You won't hurt me, will you? Jerry was doing him good. 'Yes, you shall see them,' Arthur replied; and he led her into the room where Gretchen's picture looked at them from the window. 'Oh, my!' Jerry exclaimed, with bated breath, 'Ain't she lovely! 'Can Harold come, too? Good-bye!' 'Nothing,' Frank replied, although it seemed to him it was the shadow speaking for him, or at least putting the lie into his mouth. Oh, Gretchenâ"' There was a sob now in his voice, and he seemed to be talking to himself rather than to his brother, who said to him: 'Gretchen lived in Wiesbaden, then?' Do you believe she is dead?' 'Well, then,' Frank continued, 'if she did, and were living, she would have come to you, or answered your letters, or sent you some messenger.' And it, was then more than three years since I had seen her. I am afraid she is dead.' 'No, pet,' he answered, 'only tired. Why, Jerry dresses herself, and wipes the dishes, and wears those big aprons all the time. Do you understand?' His stomach was well enough, he said. 'Iss. Mrs. Tracy, who seldom troubled herself with her brother-in-law's affairs, knew nothing of his having sent for Jerry, and was surprised when she saw her coming up the walk with Charles, whose manner indicated that he knew perfectly what he was about. Tracy sent me for her. Mrs. Tracy dared not interfere with Arthur, even if he took Jerry to live there altogether, and, with a bend of her head, she signified to Charles that the conference was ended. 'Well, then, Cherry,' Arthur continued, 'take off that bonnet, and open the blind behind me so I can see your face. Jerry had dropped the shades to shut out the sunlight, and was walking on tiptoe round the room, arranging the furniture and talking to herself in whispers, as she usually did when playing alone. 'Jerry,' Arthur said to her, and she was at his side in a moment, 'you are an enchantress. Jerry hesitated a little. she asked, as he sat white and trembling in his chair. 'Oh, nothing, nothing,' he groaned, 'I cannot stand any more now.' 'Well, then, you sit still, and I'll clean house; it needs it badly. Jerry responded, and Arthur recognized Mrs. Crawford, whose tidiness and cleanliness were proverbial, and for the next half hour he watched the little actress as she limped around the room exactly as Mrs. Crawford limped with her rheumatism, sweeping, dusting, and scolding a little, both to Harold and Jerry, the latter of whom once retorted: 'I would not be so cross as that if I had forty rheumatisses in my laigs, would you, Harold?' 'Jerry,' he said, 'I guess you have cleaned house long enough. 'Oh, a hundred bushelsâ"him and grandma, too.' 'Yes; and I tooâ"to the district; but I hate it!' Jerry replied. 'What is the matter with the district school?' Wants to kiss me. A-a-h, and says I am to be his wife, and he has got warts on his thumb!' Well, what boys do you like?' 'A governess,' was Jerry's answer. 'Why, Maude is your little girl, isn't she? Of this, however, Jerry did not speak. He is trying to learn Latin and recites to Dick St. Claire; but grandma says it is up-hill business. Oh, if I's only rich I'd give it all to Harold, and he should get learning like Dick. I am glad I wore my best gown. It won't dirty the chair a bit.' Now, what will you have?' I am going to drive you in the phaeton. I am going to show you the country,' Arthur replied, as he chirruped to the fleet pony who seemed to fly along the smooth road. On the homeward route they met the victoria, with John upon the box, and Mrs. Tracy and Maude inside. He is trying to save enough to go to the High School, but it's slow work. I can do but little myself, and it all falls upon Harold.' 'But I like it, grandma. 'Yes, trying to kiss you, though I do not blame him much for that,' Arthur said, with a smile, and then continued: 'She is ambitious enough to want a governess like Ann Eliza Peterkin and my brother's daughter, but I am better than a dozen governesses. 'What is it, Cherry?' 'Yes, oh, yes; but it don't seem real, andâ"andâ"I guess it makes me kind of sick,' Harold gasped, as, freeing himself from Jerry's encircling arm, he hurried from the room, to think over this great and unexpected joy which had come so suddenly to him. I'm come to school.' Tracy, if that is Jerry to whom you are talking, send her up at once. Jerry was to be educated and cared for, and would probably receive all that the world would naturally concede to her if the truth were known. Jerry was a great trouble to him, and he would not have liked to confess to any one how constantly she was in his mind, or how many plans he had devised in order to atone for the wrong he knew he was doing her. he answered, promptly: 'None, 'cause Tom would eat them all.' But it was not quite as thrilling as at first; the him for whom the dying woman had prayed was omitted, and the whole was mixed with the Tramp House, and the carpet-bag, and Harold, who was now a youth of seventeen, and a student at the high school in Shannondale, where he was making as rapid progress in his studies as Jerry was at the park. I thought it was a tramp!' 'Yes, pretty often. I talk to her and ask her to tell me, but she never has. Oh, don't you wish she would?' Frank shuddered involuntarily, for to have Jerry told who she really was, was the last thing he could desire, but as a criminal is said always to talk about the crime he has committed and is hiding, so Frank, when with Jerry, felt impelled to talk with her of the past and what she could remember of it. was the abrupt reply. I thought he had given that up. I thought heâ"Did he say, "Write to her friends?"' 'Oh, I know that. Was she black?' was Jerry's answer. He said this interrogatively, and Jerry answered him promptly: 'I think he would give it to me.' 'Yes, well; Jerry, can you keep a secret, and never tell any one what I am saying to you?' Arthur.' 'No, no, no, Jerry, never!' Will you do it? Jerry replied. 'I could swear you were Gretchen, singing to me in the twilight, and across the meadow comes the tinkle of the bells where the cows and goats are feeding,' he said to her, as he paced up and down the room.' 'Cherry,' he said at last, using the pet name he often gave her, 'you are some like Gretchen as she must have been when of your age. Oh, if you only were hers and mine! Jerry read it aloud slowly, for the handwriting was cramped and irregular, and then looked up questioningly to Arthur, who said to her: 'What do you think she meant by the something which would make me glad as she was?' It is gone, and I cannot recall it.' They were awful yesterday and to-day,' Jerry replied. How he must have loved her, better than you or I could ever love anybody; don't you think so?' 'What if she should think me a clown and a clodhopper, as Tom Tracy does?' Do you?' 'No, Jerry,' Harold answered, laughingly. 'Forever and ever, amen!' Mrs. Tracy was going to have a partyâ"not a general one, like that which she gave when our readers first knew her, and Harold Hastings stood at the head of the stairs and bade 'the ladies go this way and the gentlemen that.' Mrs. Tracy would have liked to have had Jerry in the upper hall, where Harold had once stood. 'You just make a hermit of yourself,' she said, 'cooped up here all the time. I don't wonder folks say you are crazy. 'I'll do it, Cherry. Mrs. Tracy knew that he was sometimes sent by his grandmother on some errand to Arthur, and giving no further thought to the matter went on to her own room, which her maid had put in order. 'I shall wear my dark blue satin and diamonds,' she said to her maid, who was dressing her hair, but the diamonds, when looked for, were not in their usual place. The diamonds were gone, nor could any amount of searching bring them to light. And this was the verdict of all except Mrs. Tracy, who now recalled the fact that she, too, had seen Harold 'sneaking through the door as if he did not wish to be seen.' she asked, but no one volunteered any information until Charles suggested that he probably came on some errand to Mr. Arthur; he would inquire, he said, and he went at once to his master's room. 'But he must have been here that morning,' Charles continued. 'I tell you no one was here. I am not quite demented yet. Now go. He will know what he was doing here,' was Mrs. Tracy's next peremptory remark, and her husband said to her, reproachfully: 'Surely you do not intend to charge him with the theft?' 'But it is noon,' Harold said, glancing up at the sun. On the afternoon of the day of the party he had been at Grassy Spring, helping Mrs. St. Claire with her flowers, and after his work was done he had gone with Dick into the billiard-room, where they found Tom Tracy and his friend, young Raymond. 'We can't wait here all day for Dick,' Tom said. I don't think I have seen him before; he is a right clever chap,' Fred Raymond said. Tom replied, in that sneering, contemptuous tone which Harold knew so well, and which always made his blood boil and his fingers tingle with a desire to knock the speaker down: 'Oh, that's Hal Hastings, a poor boy, who does chores for us and the St. Claires. Besides that, what's the use of education to chaps like him. I don't believe in educating the masses, do you?' They went directly to Mrs. Tracy's room, where they found that lady in a much higher fever of excitement than when she first discovered her loss. he repeated, without the shadow of an idea that she could in any way connect him with a theft; nor would the idea have come to him at all, if Tom had not said to him with a sneer: 'Better own up, Hal, and restore the property. It is your easiest way out of it.' You, who are not fit to tie his shoes! And do you want to know why he was here that morning? No, sir! Diamonds, indeed! With this grain of comfort, the boy went slowly home, humiliated and cut to the heart with the indignity put upon him; while Jerry walked silently at his side, never speaking a word until they were nearly home, when she said, suddenly: 'I know where the diamonds are, but I shan't tell now while there is such a fuss;' but Harold was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to pay much attention to the remark, although it recurred to him years after, when the diamonds came up to confront him again. 'The diamonds; Mrs. Tracy's diamonds; the ones you gave her,' was Jerry's answer. Who are they, Jerry?' 'Mr. 'Certainly. 'Undoubtedly. They ought to.' 'Yes, or something as bad.' 'Yes, work till his hands drop off,' Arthur said. Why, what does ail you? 'Come in here? 'But I don't want to lie down and be smothered with cushions,' Arthur returned, puzzled, and wondering at the excitement of the child, who nestled close to his side and held fast to his hand, as if she were guarding him, or expected him to guard her, while the examination went on outside, and the frightened and angry servants submitted to having their boxes and trunks examined. Then Frank knocked at his brother's door and asked admittance. 'Why, Cherry, what is it? 'Oh, I don't know,' the sobbed; 'only I was so scared all the time they were in the room. 'Would you? Jerry asked, eagerly, as she lifted her tear-stained face to Arthur's. So, why not be a substitute, and go to prison, if necessary?' 'Certainly, or be an accessory to the crime,' was Arthur's reply. Punish herâ"him, I meanâ"just the same?' 'Yes, of course,' Arthur said, scarcely heeding what she was asking him, and never dreaming of the wild fancy which had taken possession of her. 'Well, that beats me!' Oh, I hope I shan't have to do it! 'I may as well begin to practice, and see if I can bear it,' she thought, as she walked slowly home, where she astonished Mrs. Crawford by asking her to make some mush for dinner. Make it for me, please. and 'Oh, Jerry, how you look!' Mrs. Crawford asked a little angry and a good deal astonished; but Jerry only answered at first with her tears, as Harold jeered at her forlorn appearance and called her a picked chicken. 'Jerry,' Harold exclaimed, in amazement, and but dimly comprehending her real meaning, 'you are crazy, to be playing you are a convict! 'Ye-es,' Jerry sobbed; 'but I can't bear it, and I hope they will not find him,' 'Him! 'The one who took the diamonds,' she replied. 'No, no, Hally,' Jerry replied. I could do it for you and Mr. Arthur, but for no one else. Oh, I hope they will never find them.' 'I shall never tell!' I could, if you would let me. 'Cherry,' he said to her one day when he came as usual, and her first eager question was, 'Have they found them?' 'Jerry, try and understand me. Do you know where the diamonds are?' Where are the diamonds?' But by this time Jerry was in the prison, sleeping on a board and eating bread and mush, and Arthur failed to get any satisfaction from her. Tracy had her diamonds again and did not know how they came to her. You know he seemed very indifferent at first.' 'Mr. Jerry exclaimed. 'Well, that beats me!' 'Of course he is. Jerry repeated, quickly. I thought you had come in to wake me up, and I was glad, for I have had horrid dreams.' 'And you've been crazy, too, as a loon,' he continued, 'and talked the queerest things about state prison, and hard boards, and bread and water, and accessories, and substitutes, and so on. 'I could not make you do that. I asked you ever so many times if you knew who took the diamonds, and you said "Yes," but when I asked who it was, you always answered, "Don't you wish you knew?" Still I knew it was about the diamonds, for I understood that word. There, hark! 'Well, Cherry,' he said to her, as he drew a chair to her bedside, 'Mrs. Crawford tells me the bees are out of your head this morning, and I am glad. Mrs. Tracy has some diamonds, and is the happiest woman in town.' Jerry had not noticed his exact words, and only understood that Mrs. Tracy had found her diamonds. Cherry, let go. Are you sure she did not suspect!' she asked. Why, Jerry, what is the matter? You do not look glad a bit. I thought you wanted me to give them to her surreptitiously, and I did,' he continued, as the expression of Jerry's face changed to one of blank dismay and disappointment, and the tears gathered in her eyes. 'Of course not,' he answered, with a little irritation in his tone. Are you crazy, like myself? You ought to remember; you do things you ought not to do. Jerry asked, eagerly, for she knew the meaning of the word 'responsible.' 'Certainly not,' was the reassuring reply, 'Don't you know how many murders are committed and the murderer is not hung, because they say he is crazy?' Good-bye, and never say diamonds to me again; it gets me all in aâ"m aâ"well, a French pickleâ"mixed, you know.' With this load lifted from her mind Jerry's recovery was rapid, and when the autumnal suns were just beginning to tinge the woodbine on the Tramp House and the maples in the park woods with scarlet, she took her accustomed seat in Arthur's room and commenced her lessons again with Maude, who had missed her sadly and who would have gone to see her every day during her sickness if her mother had permitted it. Do you know what it is?' Jerry hesitated a moment, and then she asked: 'Is it the diamonds?' No. 'Of course not. 'Oh, I can't do itâ"I can't! 'Oh, Jerry, it is you,' he said, as the little girl crossed the threshold, and shutting the door, stood with her back against it, and her hands behind her. 'What is it?' 'The one I promised to bring you to show youâ"the one to Germany,' was Jerry's answer. 'Yes, yes, I know; give it to me,' he said, advancing rapidly toward her, and putting out his hand. Give it to me, please.' The postmaster has to do it, and any one who took it to the office would do it if he could.' Frank repeated, 'That is not Gretchen. But it all came back to her now, and her tears fell like rain as she stood for a moment irresolute. 'Give it to me, please. You do not mean to keep it?' Do you think I intend to keep the letter? I am going to the office, and will take it myself. Good-bye, and do not look so worried. Do you take me for a villain?' Will you let us go over it and take a survey?' 'Certainly; go where you like,' Frank said, struggling to reach the door; but Peterkin button-holed him and held him fast, while he continued: 'I say, Tracy, heard anything from them diamonds?' 'Nothing,' was the reply. 'Oh, nothin',' Peterkin replied; 'only them diamonds never went off without hands, and them hands ain't a thousand miles from the park.' Tracy, is that you? Frank said, as he reined his horse close up to her. she asked again, as they left the gate behind them and struck into the lane. 'No,' Jerry answered. I don't believe, either, that any harm will come to Maude from that letter, as you said. Jump down, Jerry, and good-night to you.' 'You have hit the nail on the head this time, for it was a groan,' Frank said, as he plunged into bed; and Dolly, as she undressed herself deliberately, and this time put her diamonds carefully away, little dreamed what was passing in the mind of the man, who, all through the long hours of the night, lay awake, seldom stirring lest he should disturb her, but repeating over and over to himself, the words: 'Lost now forever and ever, but if Maude is happy I can bear it.' She spelled her name with an ie now, instead of a y. I did not know that. I don't think he ever took his eyes off you from the time you sat down to the piano until you left it, and when I said to him, "Doesn't she sing like an angel, and isn't the lovely?" Billy Peterkin, and Tom Tracy, and Dick St. Claire, and even Fred Raymond, from Kentucky, who was supposed to be devoted to Nina. Jerry was there, and saw and heard. Oh, I am so proud of him!' Jerrie's approval was worth more to the young man than that of all the rest; for he knew that, though she would be very lenient toward him, she was a keen and discriminating critic, and would detect a weakness which many an older person would fail to see. 'You have such a splendid voice, and read so well,' she wrote, 'that it will rest her just to listen to you, and will keep her from being so lonely; so offer your services if she does not ask for themâ"that's a good boy.' 'I shall not come to hear you spout out your erudition,' he said, 'for I detest crowds, with the dreadful smell of the rooms. Do you think I shall pass muster?' I thought for a moment it was Gretchen speaking to me. You know, she was with me, and helped me select it. They were standing side by side before a long mirror, she taller for a woman than he was for a man, so that her face was almost in a range with his, as he stooped a little forward. was Jerrie's next question, put hesitatingly. 'Yes. 'You never received an answer to that letter, did you?' I don't know what you mean,' Arthur said, the old worried look settling upon his face, which always came there when he was trying to recall something he ought to remember. With the words, 'What if it were so?' Dear mother, what do I care how black she was, and coarse. 'I may not be home,' he said. Crowds kill me, and smells kill me, and we are sure to have both. I don't see a fault in him, except that he is too infernally proud. Think of his refusing to take any more money from me unless I would accept his note promising to pay it all back in timeâ"just as if he ever can, or will.' 'I shall teach school, or give music lessons, or do both to earn something for grandmother,' Jerrie answered, quickly. and now she has what she calls a studio, where she perpetrates the most atrocious daubs you ever saw. I did not care for her once, but we are great friends now, and she is a comfort to me in your absence. I am afraid, though, that she is not long for this world. But, hold on! Mrs. Tracy is not pleased with Harold's visits, and I once overheard her saying to Maude, "Why do you encourage the attentions of that young man? why do you run after him so, down there every day?" Hold on, again! Why don't I stick to Dolly, who said, "You certainly do not care for him. 'No,' Jerrie said, slowly, as if speaking were an effort. Yes. Why shouldn't he like a girl as pretty as she is, especially when she meets him more than half way?' Don't be lightly won. But, child, you look fagged and tired. No, no, I shall not tell any secrets. TRACY PARK, June â"â", 18â". I am glad you are so good friends." Uncle Arthur says his mother was lovely, and that his father was one of the handsomest men of his time, but I am certain that Harold looks better than either of them, and has inherited the good qualities of both, without a single bad one. But I did not like it a bit when I heard he had accepted a situation in Peterkin's furnace. When I told Uncle Arthur he laughed, and said: "Honor and shame from no condition rise." I asked Tom, and he said I was a fool. And do you remember the expression of his face when he picked up the bouquet of roses I threw him, and looked over where we sat? I thought he touched his lips to them, but was not sure. Do you remember? He came of his own accord, too. I did not ask him, or even hint, as Tom says I do, when I want anything; and sometimes I half think he is trying to drive something into my head, or was, when he began to read to me about those old Greeks, Hesiod, or Herod, I don't know which, and Theogonyâ"that's rather a pretty name, don't you think so? Do you remember how I cried? '"Yes, Maude," he said. Oh, if the years and everything could be blotted out!" But I don't see it, do you? You think me too black, and small, and thin, and so I am. Uncle Arthur does not talk much of her now, though I believe he kisses her every night and morning. Do you really chew an awful lot there, or is it a fib? Do you know, it sometimes frightens me to think how devotedly I could love some one. Not a girl, but a manâ"a loverâ"a husband, who loved me. Dick is nice, and I like him, but not that way. He comes here occasionally to see Tom, and always talks of you. You know he was with mamma and me in England, and since his return has effected everything English, and looks quite like the dude of the period. 'Oh, Jerrie, I am glad you are coming home! You know, she says to her mother: '"I shall hear you when you pass, With your feet above me, in the long and pleasant grass." 'Oh, Jerrie, if it should beâ"you know what I mean; if there should come a time when people say to each other, "Maude Tracy is dead!" 'Now, good-bye again. 'Truly and lovingly, 'P.S.â"Tom has come in, and says, "Give my love to Jerrie." 'P.S. No. 'P.S. No. The he way Harold, for whom Jerrie asked at once. You see, he has taken a job which must be done at a certain time.' 'Thank you,' Jerrie answered, curtly. 'Yes, b-b-by Jove. Hal, you know, isn't very flush in the pocket.' But if you like him, all right. Stick to him, and I'll stand by you to the death.' She knows what she is about, and would not wipe her shoes on Hal Hastings, much less marry him. I know. But, alas for poor Harold's gift! They were Harold's roses, which he had sent to her, and she prized them more than all the rest she had received. 'Oh, I can't take that, Ann Eliza said; he didn't mean it for me; he didn't give me anything, and Iâ"Iâ"' Here she began to sob again, and laying her hand pityingly upon the bowed head, Jerrie said: 'Yes, I know; I understand. the girl asked, lifting her head suddenly. 'Not a particle, as you mean. I'll think of it, and let you know when I make up my mind to come. I'll have towers, and bay-windows, and piazzers, with checkered work all 'round 'em, and a preservatory, and all kinds of new fangled doin's. Yes, sir! But it was, immediately. 'Yes, yesâ"Lubber-toe; that'll suit May Jane tip-top. Do you?' Why, what in thunder! 'Tain't nothin'!' Fridays.' You know what I mean.' 'You've hit it, square. Now I'd like a picter of the Lizy Ann, as she was, but May Jane won't hear to't. 'Tain't good manners, and I know it, as well as the next one. 'Possibly she will not like this drawing at all. 'Try again, squire; but give us some kind of water and craft.' On the contrary, as he grew into society they gradually withdrew, until at last Dolly Tracy had it all her own way and looked upon herself as the lady par excellence of the town. Will you help me?' 'Certainly you could,' Arthur replied. Do you think of going there? If you do, go to Wiesbaden, and inquire for Gretchenâ"how she died, and where she was buried. 'Oh, I don't knowâ"I don't know as ever,' Frank answered quickly; and yet in his heart there was the firm resolve to go to Wiesbaden and hunt up Marguerite Heinrich's friends, if possible. Come, jump in,' she continued, as she herself stepped into the victoria. 'Jump in, and I will take you home in a jiffy. It won't hurt Hal to walk, although he is awful tired.' 'But I would rather walk; take Harold, if he is so tired,' Jerrie said, in a tone she did not quite intend. 'Oh, Jerrie,' Harold exclaimed, in a low, pained voice, 'I am not tired, let us both walk,' and going to Maude he said something to her which Jerrie could not hear, except the words, 'Don't you think it better so?' 'Of course I do; it was stupid in me not to see it before,' was Maude's reply, as she laid her hand on Harold's arm where it rested a moment, while she said her good-byes. 'No, no,' Maude answered quickly, as if she did not like the question. 'Not sick a bit, only a little tired. Good-bye. Oh, Tom, I forgot! Now hop in, quick, and don't tear my flounces. Mrs. Crawford was naturally very economical, and could make one dollar go further than most people could two; so that very little sufficed for their daily wants when Jerrie was away. 'Yes, take him,' Peterkin said to his foreman, 'take him, and put him to the emery wheel; that's the place for such upstarts; that'll take the starch out of him double quick. He's a bad egg, he is, and proud as Lucifer. I don't suppose he'd touch my Bill or my Ann'Lizy with a ten-foot pole. I don't mind the work. I am getting used to it, but the boys are awful. Billy, who was Harold's fast friend, was now in the business with his father, and as he chanced to be present, the thing was soon arranged, and Harold received into the office at a salary of twelve dollars per week, which was soon increased to fifteen and twenty, and at last, as the autumn advanced and Harold began to talk of taking the same school in town which he had once before taught, he was offered $1,500 a year, if he would remain, as foreman of the office, where his services were invaluable. And, besides, she can see the Tramp House she is so fond of. Where was Jerry then, I wonder! 'Oh, don't!' 'Jerrie would not like it. I was never so druv in my life.' Mrs. Tracy was greatly opposed to Maude's going so often to the cottage, wondering what pleasure she could find in seeing an old house repaired, and predicting that she would make herself sick. We do not want any drones in the hive, do we, Hally?' 'And you'll not tell Jerrie a word about the room!' Maude charged him again and again, while they were in New York selecting the dress. Pinched himself, in every way, of course. But you know that. I saw it in your face at Vassar, and saw something else, too, which you may think is a secret. Yes, Jerrie is coming, Gretchen." How he loves herâ"Jerrie, I mean; and I do not wonder, do you?' he added, as he stopped to look in and admire it. 'Oh, that's it, is it?' 'Well, I don't care,' Jerry replied, with a sob in her voice. Everybody had some friend there, but myself. I remembered what a help it was to me when I was graduated to see your face in the crowd, and know by its expression that you were satisfied.' 'Oh, I didn't know that. They were close to the Tramp House now. 'But he is one of the best-hearted fellows in the world;' Harold said, 'he has been very kind to me.' But, oh, Harold, how I hate it allâ"your being obliged to work for such a man as Peterkin. 'Yes, often,' Harold said. 'Possibly,' Harold replied. I saw it. I was the little child. 'Ye-es,' Jerrie said, slowly, 'I may. Tell me again about that night, and the morning; what they did at the park houseâ"Mr. Arthur, I mean. Do you know? Was it Gretchen he expected?' He said she was in the ship with him and on the train, but she wasn't. 'What if it were so?' 'Jerrie!' 'You have brought me nearly all the happiness I have ever known; for when I was a boy and every bone ached with the hard work I had to doâ"the thought that Jerry was waiting for me at home, that her face would greet me at the window, or in the door, made the labor light; and now that I am a manâ"' He paused a moment, and Jerrie's head dropped a little, for his voice was very low and soft, and she waited with a beating heart for him to go on. But come, I have kept you here too long, and grandma must be wondering where we are.' Was it because of that foolish speech of mine about knocking my brains out, the ceiling was so low?' I am glad you like it.' 'But it was a pleasure, Jerrie,' he said.' 'Oh, Mah-nee,' she sobbed, laying her face upon the rough, coarse garments, 'I am not disloyal to you in trying to believe that you were not my mother, and could you come back to me, Mah-nee, whoever you are, I'd be to you so loving and true. Tell me, Mah-nee, who I am; give me some sign that what comes to me so often of that far-off land is true. Oh, if it were Gretchen who worked this letter, then I can touch what her hands have touchedâ"the little dimpled hands in the picture,' and she kissed the 'M' as fervently as if it had been Gretchen's lips and Gretchen were her mother. On the old brass ring the key to the trunk and carpet-bag were still fastened, together with the small straight key, for which no use had ever been found. 'I shall get the start of her,' she said, as she donned a simple working dress which had done her service during the summer vacations for three successive years. 'What in the world!' I did not tell you last night that a Mr. Allen, who lives across the river, four miles away, looked in one day when I was painting your ceiling, and liked it so much that he has engaged me to paint one for him. I don't wonder Mr. Allen wanted you. But you are not going to tramp four miles on a hot morning, on nothing but bread and coffee, and such coffeeâ"muddier than the Missouri River! Just sit down and rest, and see what a Vassar with a diploma can do.' 'No, no, Jerrie. 'Jerrieâ"Jerrie, that is for your breakfast and grandma's. 'But I shall take half of it. 'Thank you, Jerrie,' he said, picking up the rose as he finished his breakfast. If it would not be very improper, I'd like to kiss you.' Good-bye,' and offering her his hand, he started down the lane at a rapid pace, thinking the morning the loveliest he had ever known, and wondering why everything seemed so fresh, and bright, and sweet. Not at all likely. Yes, he would sound Maude, very cautiously at first, and get her opinion, and then he should know better what to do. 'Lie and rest,' Jerrie answered laughingly. 'Now, grandma,' she said, when breakfast was over. Jerrie's first impulse was to do as her grandmother bade her, and her second to stay where she was. But I think I can; anyway, I am going to try. They were not with her on the car, unless she hid them in the paper box she carried so carefully. And this was the secret of Tom's early call. 'Oh, thank you, Tom,' she said, 'it was so kind in you. Roses are my favorites after the white pond lilies, and these are very sweet.' 'I'd like you to drive with me,' Tom said, 'but I see you are too busy. Must you do that work, Jerrie? 'Grandmother! No, indeed!' 'Grandma has worked enough,' she continued, as she plunged both her arms into the water. 'Oh, Tom,' Jerrie said, recalling with a pang the thin face, the blue-veined hands, the tired look of the young girl at the station. 'Oh, Tom, why didn't you tell me before, so I could hurry and go to her;' and leaning over her tub Jerrie began to cry, while Tom looked curiously at her, wondering if she really cared so much for his sister. You know, perhaps, that she was here constantly with Harold, and I believe she actually painted for him some, and for aught I know helped shingle the roof, as Billy said.' 'But she will not die; that is nonsense,' Tom began when he was interrupted by Mrs. Crawford, who called out: 'Oh, Jerry, here is Billy Peterkin, with his hands full. 'Jerrie, Jerrie! you must come now, for here is Dick St. Claire.' Send him in.' 'By George, this is jolly!' 'No,' Jerrie answered, proudly. 'By George!' 'Of course not. Well, I am in for it, and Nina can't any more than kill me.' I counted upon him,' Dick said. 'But you will come, of course, and I offer my services on the spot to see you home. Do you accept them?' very decidedly. Frank Tracy was a natural gardener, and had lavished piles of money upon the grounds, in which he often worked himself, and where he was busy now with a clump of roses when Tom drove up with Jerrie. 'But she cannot talk just yet,' he said. They were ascending the staircase now, and Frank was holding Jerrie's hand while she tried to comfort and reassure him, and then thanked him for the fruit and the flowers he had sent to the cottage for her the day before. 'Would you like to go in?' 'But you forget Gretchen. Come.' 'Oh, I can almost remember,' she whispered, just as Frank's voice broke the spell by saying: 'Good-morning, Gretchen. On the threshold she met Mrs. Frank, just coming out, and elegantly attired in a tasteful muslin wrapper, with more lace and embroidery upon it than Jerrie had ever worn in her life; her hair was carefully dressed with a cap which looked like a pen-wiper or doll's bonnet, it was so small, perched on the top of it; her face was powdered, and her manner was one of languor and fine-ladyism, which she had cultivated so assiduously and achieved so successfully. 'But I could not come sooner. I had a large washing to do, and that takes time, you know.' You ought to, for a part of Maude's life and strength is in it.' 'Tom told me, and your mother. He will come when he can see youâ"to-morrow, maybe. Jerrie's talent for imitation and ventriloquism had not deserted her, although as she grew older, she did not so often practice it as when a child; but she brought it into full play now to amuse Maude, and imitated every individual of whom she spoke, except Arthur. Do you hear from him often?' 'Jerrie, Jerrie,' she sobbed, 'you think I am going to die, I know you do, and so does everybody, but I am not; I cannot die when there is so much to live for, and my home is so beautiful, and I love everybody so much, andâ"' Terrified beyond measure, Jerrie put her hand over Maude's mouth and said, almost sharply: 'If you want to live you must not talk. Oh, Tom, I know she hurt herself worrying about my room as she did, and if she dies I shall never like it again.' 'Nonsense,' Tom answered, carelessly. Jerry asked, sharply. is one's respected sire: the old man, some call him, but I am more respectful. My gracious, though! I'm nearly baked, you make me walk so fast!' 'You have let me go alone a hundred times, and after dark, too, when I was much smaller than I am now, and less able to defend myself, supposing there was anything to fear, which there is not. Pray go back, and not trouble yourself for me.' 'I shall not go back,' Tom said. You know I have travelled a great deal, and been in the very best society; and, if I may say it, I think I can marry almost any one whom I choose. I did not mean to ask you quite so soon, but the sight of you this morning washing your clothes, with all that soapy steam in your face, decided me not to put it off. 'You have plenty of money of your own?' Uncle Arthur, you know, is in no condition to make a will now. 'You have taken counsel, then?' was the next query. If you mean to insinuate a thing which is not good and pure against Gretchen, I'll never speak to you as long as I live! Tom replied, with a laugh. Think of some oneâ"say a young ladyâ"walking in upon us some day and claiming to be Arthur Tracy's daughter!' Will you name the day, Jerrie?' 'Jerrie, oh, Jerrie, you don't mean it! You do not refuse me!' She threw herself at my head, but one thought of you was enough to keep me from her. 'But I am. 'But I tell you he can't do it. Good-morning; it is time for me to be at my drudgery, as you call it.' 'And I'll do it now,' she said, at last, to herself. 'Oh, grandma, why did you do it? 'I c-c call that mean, T-t-tom. I don't like the game, and there are enough without me.' 'Thank you, Tom,' Jerrie said, with a bright smile on her face, which made the young man's heart beat fast with both pleasure and pain, as he gave her the mallet and told her she was to play first. 'Oh, no; it was in a house we rented in Wiesbaden. You know, perhaps, that I was there at school for a long time. 'Oh, no,' Marian replied: 'it did not seem to belong to anybody. 'Yes; and the picture was like me, you sayâ"how like me?' Are you sick?' Was it her old home Marian was describing? Do you expect to go there and live in it?' 'Oh, don't trouble about me. 'No, Dick, no; please don't,' she said. 'Oh, I am so afraid of thunder! 'Oh, Tom, aren't you a bit afraid?' Do you think we shall be struck?' No. 'Oh, Tom, Tomâ"please not so fast. Take off your boots, if they hurt you. They were out of the woods and park by this time, and had struck into a field as a shorter route to Le Bateau. 'Oh, I don't know. Oh, what shall we do, and am I going to die?' Tom answered, gloomily. 'But we are in an awful muss, and I don't know what to do. Here it is raining great guns, and I am wet to my skin, and you can't walk, you say. Do you think it such fun?' I can stand on one foot,' Ann Eliza said; and nothing loth Tom put her down, a most forlorn and dilapidated piece of humanity as she stood leaning against him with the light of the piazza lamp falling full upon her. Here, May Jane, come lively! 'Oh, father; Oh-h!â"it does hurt so. Put me somewhere quick, and take off my boot. 'What in thunder shall I do with her? 'Oh, she's dead! 'Yes, yes; but where are they?' 'By Jove, she's plucky!' 'But I didn't want to go with her. Jerrie's hat was wrenched off, as Ann Eliza's had been by the wind, which tossed her long golden hair in a most fantastic fashion. 'No, Dick,' she said, laughingly, as she saw him about to divest himself of it. 'Keep your coat. 'By Jove, we are in luck!' You were a wonderful actress, Jerrie; and it is a marvel you have not gone upon the stage.' 'An umbrella, as I live! We are in luck. but I rather like it, and like being here, too, with you, if you don't mind it. Speak to me, Jerrie, and say you will try to love me, if you do not now.' 'No, Dick; not if you waited twenty years. 'I shall never forget you, Jerrie,' he said, 'or cease to hope that you will change your mind, unlessâ"' and here he started so suddenly that the wet parasol, down which streams of water were still coursing their way to Jerrie's back, dropped from his hand and rolled off upon the bed of fine needles at his feet, just where it had been in the morning when Tom was there instead of himselfâ"'unless there is some one between us, some other man whom you love. I am very sorry.' Good-bye, and God bless you. When I see you again I shall try to be the same Dick you have always known.' Good-bye till to-night. 'Yes, lovely!' When I tried to comfort him, he said, "It isn't the hard work, grandmother; I don't mind that in the least; neither do I care for what they say, or should not, if there was not some truth in it; things are out of proportion, and the new room makes the rest of the cottage look lower than ever, and I'd like so much to have everything right for Jerrie, who would not shame the Queen's palace. I wish, for her sake, that I had money, and could make her home what it ought to be. I thought I heard his voice.' Think of it, and what my feelings must have been. Come to lunch, please. Good-bye. 'Nonsense, Leo!' Miss Ann Eliza has invited me to lunch, and I have come. 'Oh, Jerrie,' she said, 'I am so glad to see you, for it is awfully lonesome here; and if one can be homesick at home, I am. Do you believeâ"he has hunted me up a maid; Doris is her name; and what I am ever to do with her, or she with me, I am sure I don't know. Do you?' She came last night, and mamma and I are already as afraid of her as we can be, she is so fine and airy. 'Jerrie, it's Tom! 'Thunderation! I didn't want to see her. 'You needn't see her, of course; but you must go and inquire how she is. 'I shall be cheek by jowl with these Peterkins, if I don't look out,' he thought, as he ascended the stairs to the hall, where Doris stood waiting to show him her mistress' room. 'Well, if you will, you will,' she said, laughingly; and bidding Ann Eliza good-bye, and telling Tom to give her love to Maude and say to her that she did not believe she should be at the park that day, she had so much to do, she was soon in the dog-cart with Billy, whose face was radiant as he gathered up the reins and started down the turnpike, driving at what Jerrie thought a very slow pace, as she was anxious to get home. she asked. 'N-no,' Billy answered, hurriedly. 'It will h-have to co-come into co-court in a f-few days, and I am aw-awful sorry. 'But he must tell the truth, no matter who is damaged,' Jerrie said. 'You can have the south wing,' he said, 'and if the rooms ain't up to snuff now, why, I'll make 'em so. 'Jerrie Crawford! 'Jerrie Crawford! Wal, I swan!' Leave her to Harold, the sneak! 'Oh, Billy,' she said, laughing merrily. 'You can't be in earnest. So, I can never be your wife.' 'Oh, Billy, Billy,' she said. Please stop, and take me home as quickly as possible.' 'Grandma,' she said, 'this is too bad. I did not mean to stay so long. 'Dick will get over it, and marry somebody else, but Billy never,' she said. 'Jerrie Crawford,' she said, 'you must be a mean, heartless, good-for-nothing girl, for it certainly is not your Dutch face, nor yellow hair, nor great staring eyes, which make men think that you will marry them; so it must be your flirting, coquettish manners. and now she might have asked, 'Why do these same boys wish to marry me?' 'Ye-es, I guess I canâ"if you'll go with me,' he said. she began, as she gave him her little, thin hand. I am glad you have spoken; and you have made me very happy; and even if we can never be more to each other than we are now, because I may die, as I sometimes fear I shallâ"' 'Oh, Maude, Maude, you are mistaken. I am going to die, but you have made the last days of my life very, very happy.' 'What is it?' she asked, sharply; then, as she saw Maude's face she knew what it was, and going swiftly to her, said to Harold: 'Why did you allow her to talk and get excited? I am very sorry.' 'You can go now,' she said, returning to the couch, and dismissing him with her usual hauteur of manner; while Maude put up her hand and whispered: 'Come soonâ"and Jerrie.' But, oh, Heaven! 'Spare Maude; do not let her die!' 'What is it, pet?' But by and by his hands shall be white like Tom's, though not so soft. I am glad he came.' You do me so much good, and I am a great deal better for your being here.' I did not tell you that Harold was going away to-night, did I?' 'I shall never have rest or peace again until it is known. Oh, if it would only come out without my telling,' he said to himself, little dreaming how near it was to coming out and that before that day's sun had set Jerrie would know! 'Jerrie, you here? Why, what's the matter? Sit down here,' he continued, as he saw Jerrie reel forward as if she were about to fall. Billy, however, was more conscious. The giddiness is gone,' Jerrie replied. 'I'm afraid I'm going to be sick,' she said to herself. Wake up, Jerrie! 'And you are a fool, too,' was the affectionate rejoinder. If it is, I b'lieve I'll shoot him.' And this he did with a thought of Jerrie in his heart, though with no suspicion that she was there; and when he saw her he started suddenly, and uttered an exclamation of surprise, which roused her from her heavy slumber. Yes, you orter. Do you hear me, gal?' 'Hoity-toity, miss! 'I shall hinder you,' she said, her voice ringing clear and distinct; 'and if you breathe another word against Harold, I'll turn you from this room. Jerrie's face was a face to fear then, and Peterkin was afraid, and backed himself out of the room, with Jerrie close to him, never speaking a word, but motioning him to the door, through which he passed swiftly, and picking up his bag, walked rapidly away, growling to himself: 'There's the very Old Harry in that gal's eye. 'Jerrie,' he exclaimed, 'how late you are! Why, what ails you, and where have you been?' 'What is it? 'How came you by them, and where did you find them,' Harold asked next, shrinking a little from the glittering stones which seemed like fiery eyes confronting him. 'Hallo, Jerrie! hallo, Hal!' 'By George, I wish I were a witness. Upon my word, you look worse. Good-bye, Tom,' and she offered him her hand, a most unusual thing for her to do on an ordinary occasion like this. Was she sorry for her decision, and did she wish to revoke it? Mrs. Crawford was in the garden when Jerrie entered the house, and thus there was no one to see her as she hurried up stairs and hid the leather bag away upon a shelf in her dressing-room. Dear Harold; his days of labor are over, and grandmother's, too. Those diamonds are a fortune in themselves, and they are mine! 'What if that dreadful taint should be in my blood, or what if I should die just as I have found my mother! 'Jerrie, Jerrie,' Mrs. Crawford cried in alarm, as she tried to remove the girl's clothes. 'What is it, Jerrie? 'Did Peterkin strike you, and what for?' I am glad he did it.' Mrs. Crawford asked herself in vain, and when at last the early summer morning broke, she was almost as crazy as Jerrie, who was steadily growing worse, and who was saying the strangest things about arrests and blows, and Peterkin, and Harold, and Mr. Arthur, whose name she always mentioned with a sob and stretching out of her hands, as to some invisible presence. 'Oh, Tom, Tom,' she said, 'you told me you'd kill her. Will you kill her? Will you kill her?' Will you kill her?' Jerrie's strong constitution could stand an attack much more severe than this one; and prescribing perfect quiet, with strict orders that she should see no more people than was necessary, he left, promising to return in the afternoon, when he hoped to find her better. I'll have him arrested for assault and battery, as sure as I am born.' he repeated; 'yes, more than you can ever know. Why, sometimes I think I like you almost as much as I do Maude.' Tell Maude so; tell Maude so.' Do you think Peterkin struck her?' 'But he may not,' Frank replied. 'How came he by them, then?' she asked, in a loud, angry voice. I don't believe, though, they can do anything after all these years; but father will know. He is there with him.' 'Yes, yes, I see; I know; but all that will come out on the trial,' the judge said, trying to silence him. I did not seek it. I could not help it: but, being a witness, I must answer the questions truthfully.' 'Thunder and lightning, man! 'Of course you must answer questions, but you needn't blab out stuff they don't ask you, so as to lead 'em on. 'Mr. 'Go to thunder, then! They were closely buttoned in his coat pocket, where they burned like fire, as he wondered where and how Jerrie had found them. 'Yes, they are Mrs. Tracy's diamonds; there can be no mistake,' he whispered, just as he became conscious that there was some one in the door looking at him. I seen 'em in the lookin'-glass, settin' in t'other room, and seen you look all round like a thief afore you opened 'em. Fork over, I say!' I seen it in her face when I twitted her on it, and she riz up agin me like a catamount. You tickle me, and I'll tickle you! His anxiety was all for Jerrie. 'I wi-wish I could t-t-testify f-for you, bu-but I can't. You were th-there, I wa-wan't, and all I know fa-father told me; bu-but d don't volunteer information.' Where was he now? 'Would you believe the defendant under oath?' 'Would you, if not under oath?' They are in his pocketâ"or was last night. I seen 'em myself, and he dassent deny it.' 'Lean on me, and I will get you out of this. Why don't you handcuff him, somebody? And you, Bill, be you a fool to stan' there a huggin' him as if he was a gal! 'Ha-Hal is my fr-friend, father. 'Wall, I'll be condumbed, if that don't beat all!' There ain't no law or justice for nobody but me, and I must be kicked to the wall! I'll give up, and won't try to be nobody, I vurm!' They were handed to me to keep by some one, just for a little while. 'No, a thousand times, no!' Don't talk any more about it, please; I can't bear it. Oh, I am so tired!' 'Thank you, Dick,' Harold said, the tears starting again; then, as his eye fell for the first time upon Tom, he exclaimed, with a glad ring in his voice, 'and you, too, Tom!' 'Thank you, Tom,' Harold replied, 'I don't think you ever did like me, and I don't think I cared if you didn't, but I'm glad you came. 'So,' Tom answered. 'Jerrie is very sickâ"' 'Jerrie! Oh, Tom!' Yes, you are, to hold your tongue and let some think you are the culprit. Hal, Jerrie gave you the diamonds. I did not think of it at the time, but afterward it came to me that you took something from her and slipped it into your pocket, and that you both looked scared when you saw me. I thought at first that the old wretch had quarreled with her about you on account of the suit, and she had squared up to him, and he had struck her; but now I believe he had the diamonds, and she got them from him in some way, and he struck her with the missing table-leg. If you say so, I'll have him arrested.' 'Why, he gave them to mother.' Claire.' 'Thunder and lightning and guns' old Peterkin exclaimed, while the spittle flew from his mouth like the spray from Niagara. Do you understand?' Find it, find it. To be so near, and yet so far. Am I like Mr. Arthurâ"crazy, like him?' Mrs. Crawford thought her crazier than Arthur, and waited still more impatiently for Harold, until she heard his step outside, and knew that he had come. 'Grandma!' Where are they?' 'Mrs. Tracy has them by this time,' Harold replied. 'Mrs. Tracy!' They are not hers. They are mineâ"they are mine! 'Jerrie,' he said again, 'do you love me?' Yes, more than you ever dreamed of; more than you love me.' Was it in the Tramp House?' 'When I saw how sick Jerrie was, I made up my mind not to accept it, although I need the money badly. She knows nothing about the diamonds, nor that Jerrie is sick. She wants to see you bad; but, Lord! Mrs. Crawford asked, reproachfully. And this was the view the judge took of it, after a few moments' conversation. On the whole, however, he decided that it was better to go. 'Jerrie's interests are safe with me,' he said, 'and by the time you return everything will be explained; but find Mr. Tracy as soon as possible. 'But you told me they were Mrs. Tracy's,' he said to her once. And this was all he could get from her. 'Of course not,' was Mrs. Tracy's prompt reply, when the request was taken to her. 'Mr. But it was too late now; the train had come and gone, and taken Harold with it, away from the girl he loved and from, the girls who loved him so devotedly, and both of whom, for a few days after his departure, went down very near to the gates of death, and whose first enquiry, when they at last came back to life and consciousness, was for Harold and why he stayed away. 'Pretty bad. We must telegraph if she gets worse,' was the reply, as the doctor rode on. 'No; oh, no!' Dick answered, with a gasp. 'I shall be so glad when he comes home. 'Wall, I swow!' 'Grandma!' Tell me everything.' she gasped, as Jerrie turned toward the door. was the reply. 'When I come back I will tell you all, but now I cannot wait.' Good-bye.' Mrs. Tracy was having a progressive euchre party that afternoon. 'Spare her, and I will make reparation; I will tell the truth.' Mrs. Tracy repeated, as one by one all the members of the party, even the judge and Tom, gathered close to her in their astonishment. 'The diamonds are mine, not yours. Mrs. Tracy asked. 'Thank God that it is out! I couldn't have borne it much longer,' leaped involuntarily from Frank's lips. Maude cried, exerting all her strength. 'Jerrie,' he said, slowly and thickly, for something choked his speech, 'I can't tell you now all I feel, only I am glad for you and Arthur, but gladder for myself.' Do you propose to give up so easily to a girl's bare word! Let Jerrie prove it, before she is mistress here.' They are written in German.' Let them all come up; they will have to know,' Maude persisted. Mr. They are certificates of the marriage of Arthur with Gretchen, and of Jerrie's birth. I thought so. 'I shall ask no favors of her. I can stand it if you can, though money is a good thing to have.' They are mine and I gave them to Harold to keep untill I could think what to do. The diamonds are mine.' 'No, Dolly,' he said. I was seventeen when I first saw Mr. Tracy. I don't know that I was, but he told me so when he came to me one day as I was knitting under a tree in the park. 'Oh, Jerrie!' Do you ever remember a beautiful moonlight night, when the air was soft, and warm, and sweet with many summer flowers, and there was music in the distance, and heaven seemed so near that you could almost touch the blue lining which separates it from us? Well, just like that was my life with Arthur for a few months. Oh, how I loved him, and how he loved me! In January my baby was born, and I had her christened Jerrine, by Mr. Eaton. But it was too late, for I was too weak to travel; neither could I write to him, for he gave me no address. So crazy it was, but just as full of love and tenderness and a desire to see me. But you will see in his letter what he wrote and how fond he was of me; and if he is alive and too crazy to understand now, tell him, when he is better, how I loved him and prayed for him every hour that God would bring him, at last, where I am going so soon. 'Mother!' I am not to blame. Oh, somebody lead me out where I can breathe. 'Mr. I don't suppose that Governor's daughter would look at me now, nor anyone else who is anybody. ARTHUR TRACY.' I need you. JERRIE.' 'That rascally Tom is a liar,' he said. It's Jerrie. Do you hear, it's Jerrie. It's Jerrie who needs me.' She's worse this morning, and looks as if she might die any minute.' 'Yes, or will be. 'Yes, poor as a church mouse.' Stand by her, Tom; tell mother not to be so bitterâ"it hurts me. He said, "by the great Peterkin!" I'm glad it's you, and so is Maude, and she wants to see you. Good-bye.' 'Mother, mother! I remember you as you are here, sick and sorry, but oh, so lovely!' And do you know, I think it was noble in you to tell me, when you might have kept it to yourself.' 'No, no. I couldn't have done that much longer,' he exclaimed, energetically, as he began to walk up and down the room. 'I could not bear it. But it is gone now, or will be when I have told my brother.' 'But I do mean to do it,' Frank replied, 'as a part of my punishment, and he will not forgive as you have done. He will turn me out at once, as he ought to do.' 'But, I mean to tell Maude, too,' Frank replied. They are safe, tooâ"safe from herâ"Mrs. Frank Tracyâ"who had the boldness to flaunt them in my face at a party the other night. Oh, if I had remembered you years ago as I do nowâ"' Jerrie could read no further, for the letter dropped from her hands, as she cried joyfully: 'I knew he had them. I was sure of it, though I did not know where they were.' 'Thank you, Jerrie,' he said at last, as he rose to go, 'Thank you for being so kind to me. I did not deserve it. I did not expect it. I am glad for you, and so is Maude. Will you lay again that you forgive me before I go back to Maude?' Oh, if Harold were here.' Oh, Maude, Maude, you don't know how much I love you!' 'Oh, Maude!' 'Jerrie,' she exclaimed, 'forgive me. I didn't know, I never guessed, I was go stupid; but I have been thinking so much since Harold went away. Will you tell him, Jerrie?' I want you with meâ"want you to hold my hand when I say good-bye for ever. Tracy!' 'I shall never see Harold,' she said to Jerrie; but I must live till uncle Arthur comes, and you are put in your right place.' You know she likes them so much.' Yes, here it is. "Come immediately. 'Cherry, you here!' But come with me to your rooms, and I will tell you everything.' Jerrie's hands were not strong enough to hold him then, and, wrenching himself from her, he stood confronting her with a look more like that of a maniac than any she had ever seen in him before, and which might have frightened one with nerves less strong than Jerrie's. How, when, and where is it? Give it to me quick, or tell me about it? But sit here,' and she motioned him to a large cushioned chair. 'No,' Jerrie replied. 'Oh, Cherry! oh, Gretchen! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to do it; I surely didn't. Was it long? Was it months, or was it years? Oh, Cherry, if you are deceiving me now!' Oh, don't you understand me? How old are you, Cherry?' Speak quick, for I believe I am dying.' oh, my daughter! oh, my daughter!' 'Yes, there is much more. To-morrow you will be stronger, now you must rest.' 'To think I could forget her, and she so sweet and good.' You sent them to her from England,' he replied, 'Yes, I remember. You were there and thought they were Gretchen's, did you not?' 'Ye-es,' he answered slowly. Do you know?' I thought they were Gretchen's. I remember now.' Ha, ha! They are yours.' 'But I have mother's,' Jerrie pleaded; 'and I cannot wear two sets.' 'Yes, you canâ"one to-day, one to-morrow. They are for ladies, and she is only a whitewashed one.' No, never! I want him here with you and me; and you must stay here now, day and night. Select any room or rooms you please; all is yours, my daughter.' 'But I cannot leave grandma,' Jerrie said. 'Let her come, too,' Arthur replied. 'No,' Jerrie persisted; 'that would not be best. Tracy.' He'll have to scratch for himself, though, I can tell him.' 'Yes, yes,' Arthur said, with a wave of his hand. 'Only I didn't know. I sent for him. 'Yes, yes, that's best, child. Come, my daughter.' I don't know, but if they can, I shall listen for you, and be glad when you are near me, and I know I shall wait on the golden seat by the river. I am glad for you, Jerrie. Good-bye; and you, father dear, good-bye.' 'Thunderation, mother!' 'You can see to things,' Mrs. Tracy replied. He is running the ranch, and running it well, to.' She wished it so.' I didn't mean nothin', I've ever meant nothin', and if I hev' I'm sorry for it.' 'Oh, no,' she answered quickly. I could not leave grandma alone, you know.' Come up later, if you like, and walk home with her.' 'I shall be most happy to do so,' Harold said, and then the carriage drove away, while he went in to his grandmother, who had not attended the funeral, but who knew that he had returned and was waiting for him. 'Come inâ"come in, my boy. 'Our dear little girl was fond of you, Hal. Will you go there? Jerrie's voice trembled a little, and after they were seated she was silent until Harold said to her: 'You were going to tell me of Maude;' then she started and replied: 'Yes; she wanted so much to see you and tell you herself. I don't know what she meant, but she said she had made a mistake, and I must tell you so, and that you would understand it. I loved her as I would a sister; as I did you in the olden days, Jerrie. Will you, Jerrie?' he answered, taking her hand in his. Do you remember it?' 'Grandma, Jerrie has promised to be my wife!' Well, he will do as well as any one to look after the business. Frank is no good, and Colvin is too old. So, get married at once, within a week if you like. 'I shall stay with you all day,' she continued, 'but go home at night.' 'Bless my soul, Jerrie!' I don't know what I should have given you; all I am worth, perhaps. Tell me, and it is done.' I thought so,' Jerrie said. Then Frank broke down entirely, and cried like a child. 'By George, I b'lieve I'll go and hang myself!' Good-bye. When I kiss you again, you will be my wife.' 'Oh, I hope you will! 'I shall miss her so much, and be so lonely without her. Tom stammered, trying to draw his arm from Peterkin's. I call that square, don't you?' See?' 'Encouragement, boy? But if you want to marry her, say so like a man, and I swan I'll meet you like a man, and a father!' 'Oh, Tom!' I'm to be your dad, so take it; you'll need it. Take it, Thomas.' 'Well, Annie, how did you and my lady hit it?' 'She just talked as if I were dirt, and that you were only marrying me for money. She don't like me and I don't like her, there!' But you are marrying me, not my mother, so don't cry, petite.' As soon as her father was able, she took him to them one by one. I can see it all so distinctly, and over there in the corner was the bed where she died.' Oh, Gretchen! Where are you, Cherry? Maybe she will come there some time, and know what I have done.' 'Let's buy it,' Dolly said to her husband. 'I am coming soon, Maude, very soon, to be here beside you,' he would say. And I am tired, and cold, and old, and the world is dark and dreary, and I am coming very soon.' Do you hear me, Maude? Frank Tracy, for meâ"who wronged her so. Jerrie's baby has done me good, and you, too, Dolly. 'Our grandchild and Jerrie's baby, and you are its grandmother. 'Well, you be crazy, ain't you?' Where was I then, grandpa?' Crazyman, Mr. Crazyman, don't you want some cherries?' Billy Peterkin has never married, and never will. There are many like her in real life, but only one in our story, to which we now write
