 "Train up this child for me, and I will give thee thy wages." Many other little scenes and incidents interwoven in, the story, are from life. "Well, see here, Lewie! "Here is my lovely dolly, Lewie. "No, no, Lewie! "Why do you cry, Mammy?" she asked, "mamma has not scolded you to-day, has she?" "No, love." I am afraid I was rough then, I hope I did not hurt his little hand. Mammy, do you think mamma loves me any." "How could anybody help loving you, my darling!" "But, oh! Mammy, if I thought she would ever love me as she does Lewie! No, Mammy, I do not think she loves me; but how strange it is for a mother not to love her own little girl." "Well, darling, we will talk no more of that, or we shall be saying something naughty; we will both try and do our duty, and then God will bless us, and whatever our troubles and trials may be, let us go to Him with them all. Now, darling, I must leave you." "God is always by my side, isn't he Mammy?" "And how are the children?" "Why, to tell the truth, Agnes has been very naughty, and I have been obliged to shut her up." "Agnes naughty, and shut up again! "Why, what a sad litter they have made to be sure; I did not observe it before. "Ellen, do you think so?" "Oh, Ellen, what shall I do; oh, what shall I do! said Mammy, "she has cried herself to sleep." Come, darling, we will go." Puir, fulish, young things!" But Master Harry, bless you! "Well, I can hardly tell you, Bridget. "But how the father loved her, Mrs. "Well, aunty," said she, after stooping to kiss Agnes, "you are back sooner than I expected." "Yes, dear, I was obliged to hurry; little Lewie is very ill, I fear. "Why, mamma, are you going back there again?" asked Effie. How do you feel, Emily?" "Well, do put aside those books, dear: your health is the most important thing now. "Well, I'll be very good, aunty, and I've promised the boys to take a run with them over to the pond, and see them skate; and besides, we are all invited to an entertainment in a certain snow palace, which is nearly finished, and which I have promised to grace with my presence." they cried. she asked. "Yes, all made of snow," said Albert. "But don't let us tell her all about it, Bob; I want to surprise her." that's too bad, mother; it will spoil all our fun. Why, Aggy, how do you do? "I want to whisper to you, dear mother, one minute," said little Grace. asked her mother. asked her father; "because, if it will not, I suppose I must go now." "Oh no, papa, I will wait patiently," said Effie. "Cousin Emily," said Agnes, for she too said "Cousin Emily," though there was no relationship, in fact, between them, "Cousin Emily, I wish I knew what to read and study. "Well, Agnes," that is the best knowledge you could possibly have, said Emily, "though I am far from thinking other studies unimportant; but, if I can help you in any way, I will gladly lend you books, and tell you how to study." will you, cousin Emily?" call Kitty, to bring the baby, and we'll all start." Emily and Agnes headed the procession, then came Effie and Grace, dragging a box-sled in which the baby was comfortably stowed, and Kitty, the nurse, brought up the rear, leading little Harry. "Oh, Ellen," she said, "how I have wanted you! Oh, Ellen, what would life be to me if I lose my darling. You can pray, Ellen, and God answers your prayers. "And I can say no more, Ellen. "No, Ellen, never! After an hour more of deep slumber, Lewie started and awoke. "Oh, aunty!" She says she will show me, and fix it for me, and I think I can do it. "Certainly, darling, I should think she would like it; I do not see how any mamma could help being pleased with anything her little girl made for her." There was great joy at the arrival of "Aunt Fanny," who was very lively, and always ready to enter with glee into the frolics and sports of the children. "Cousin Betty" was a distant relation of Mrs. Wharton's, a lonely old body, who lodged with a relative in a village about ten miles distant from Brook Farm. Well, I never thought nothing about comin' till yesterday, when I sat in my little room, and I got feelin' pretty dull; and thinks I to myself, I'll just borrow Mr. White's old horse, and take my old gig, and drive up to the farm, and see the folks." "Cousin Betty, who do you think is coming to see us to-night?" asked little Grace. "I'm sure I can't tell, child. "Is, hey?" Well, I will go over there, and tell you the story, some day. "Why wouldn't it do to tell the story here, Effie?" asked Agnes. asked Grace. At six o'clock the study door was locked, and there was no more admittance. "But who is he?â"who can he be?" "Oh no, not yet," cried Effie; "he must come with us for a new supply. "And how did you come, and where have you been?" said she, holding him up before cousin Tom. "No, not just now; but I was thinking of a man in our place, who used to be really a very sensible fellow; and though quite an old bachelor, he was the life of every party he attended, and more of a favorite than most of the young men. What are you writing there, uncle?" There was only one in that Christmas party who could not heartily join in the glee; it was poor Emily, to whom this scene brought back so vividly other holiday seasons passed with those who had "gone from earth to return no more," that only by a strong effort could she prevent her own sadness from casting a shade over the happiness of others; for they all loved cousin Emily so dearly, that they could not be merry when she was sad. Taking a seat by her he put his arm around her, and took her hand in his. "What, is she dying?" they asked. "Oh, no! There were some very amusing stories told in the family of cousin Betty's adventures, one of which I will relate here. "Sister come! sister come!" "Sister will stay a little while," said Agnes, kissing over and over again her beautiful little brother. "No, sister stay!â"sister shall not go!" said Lewie, in the best manner in which he could express it; but exactly how, we must be excused from making known to the reader, having a great horror of baby-talk in books. sister shall not go!" "Oh, thank you, dear uncle!" To which Mrs. Elwyn replied, "How absurd, Mr. Wharton, to talk of governing a child like that!" "Well, Mr. Wharton, to tell you the truth, nothing seems to me so absurd as all these ideas of nursery education; and the people who write books on the subject seem to think there is but one rule by which all children are to be governed." cried Lewie, pulling imperiously at her gown; "mamma! sister feels sorry, speak to sister." his mother asked. sister crying," said Lewie, pulling her with all the strength of his little hands towards Agnes. asked her mother. how pretty it is; isn't it, Lewie? Now Agnes, you may fill it with needles for me." Ah! said she; "Lewie will see a beautiful picture." Sister, come! "In one moment, then, little brother. Mamma, tell sister to come with Lewie." That was a thing he was not going to submit to, and he was so determined to watch Agnes, lest she should slip away from him, that all sleep seemed to have deserted his eyes, which were wider open, and more bright and wide awake, than ever. Come, Agnes! To which Mrs. Elwyn replied, that "Agnes was putting Lewie to sleep." "That is too bad, I declare!" From the time she entered Mr. Wharton's hospitable door, she was treated as companion, friend, and sister. No more sad, lonely hours for her, so long as she remained under that roof. There were plenty of happy, bright little faces around her; there were kind words always sounding in her ear; there were opportunities enough to be useful; there were rare and valuable books for her leisure hours. he wrote that he was married, and settled in that far distant State. There was something about the tone of this letter which Mrs. Wharton did not like, and she had a foreboding that this journey would not be for the happiness of her friend, and tried to dissuade her from undertaking it. The door was not fastened, and I opened it, and entered the church. I believe I shrieked; but I was filled with such an indescribable horror, that I know not what I did, when a hollow voice said:" "'Don't be afraid; I will not harm you.'" My heart, as the saying is, was in my throat, and I could hear its every throb. "At this the men's voices joined in the laugh, and they sounded horribly to me. "Oh, how I shrieked this time! I believe I cried 'help! But still Miss Edwards did not come, and her letters were few and far between. I found her raving in delirium, and your name, and the names of many whom I suppose to be members of your family, were constantly mingled with her ravings. When found she was a raving maniac, and is so still. "'Perhaps you have not been here long,' I said." "'O yes, ma'am, nearly fifteen years,' he answered." Better never to find my brother, than to find him here, and thus.' you're Rhoda, then! I wrote to you. From there I wrote you, when partially recovered. This had been his employment for months, the keeper said. Emily and Effie, and Agnes and little Grace." Be quiet, and I will come back very soon to take you with me. Did I ever deceive you, Rhoda?" said she, putting her hand to her head, "they have all deceived me. He deceived me!â"oh, so cruelly! I am all, all alone!" And he asked for Emily. There was no bright blush in her cheek now as she descended the stairs; it was pale and cold as marble. That was all. "Cousin Emily," Agnes called, "dear cousin Emily, may I come in?" There was no answer, but those same deep groans and now and then a plaintive moaning. Fasten the door, Agnes." I believe I could do anything for you, dear cousin Emily." "I do not want aunty and uncle to know of this till it is all over, Agnes. "And is there no danger, cousin Emily?" "Danger of what, dear?â"of death? Agnes, pray for me." There was not a groanâ"only one long-drawn sighâ"and it was over; and the result was better than their most sanguine hopes. His anxious mother was at the door in an instant, demanding admittance. "Never in the way of corporeal punishment, madam. I would save him if I can, but he must be left to me. "I want my dinner, I tell you!" I can learn that lesson in five minutes, if I have a mind." Ah! The opportunity, alas! Her son had neither respect for her authority, or regard for her wishes. Why do you scream so, dear?" asked Agnes. Oh, don't leave me!â"don't leave me, Miss Elwyn! "Oh no, Miss Elwyn, I did not dream that!" Oh, it had such great hollow eyes! Let's all go down together to Miss Emma, and ask her to come up here." "No, no; hush, children!" shrieked Carrie and Ella in a breath, and springing with one bound on to the floorâ""mercy on us! Come out here directly." I mean to tell Mrs. Arlington of you to-morrow, Miss Glenn. I am going right down to tell Mrs. Arlington about you." asked Agnes, "were you asleep?" "But, oh, Agnes!" she said, "do persuade her to let me remain, and finish my education. "Well, I do not wish to discourage you, my dear Ruth, but you must see I think that you are totally unfitted to have children under your care at present." Arlington." "Oh, Agnes," said she, "who will be the friend to me that you have been? There was a large, stout boy in Dr. Hamilton's school, of the name of Colton, a great bully and teaze, whose delight it seemed to be to torment and put into a passion one so fiery as our little hero, feeling safe from the only kind of retaliation which could injure him, as he was so much the stoutest and strongest of the two. oh, wound it not! There's one thing I will say, however. Wouldn't you, Calista?" "Twenty years, papa!â"absurd!" shrieked Miss Calista; "why, you must be losing your memory!" "Losing my memory indeed, Miss C'listy! "C'listy's scratched out her date," said little Rosa, "and so has Evelina." The lady addressed as "mamma" was the second wife of Mr. Fairland, a rather handsome, but very languid lady of forty, who was sleepily sipping her coffee during the foregoing conversation. Rosa, you witch! Jess, my chicken! come up here this minute, and speak to Miss Elwyn." Jessie screamed, and scratched, and pulled in vain. "Well, C'listy didn't know, did she?" She doesn't look like that, does she, papa?" "In school hours," said Agnes. There was no resisting the gentle kindness of Agnes, and the confidence of little Rosa was won immediately. '"Jessie and me,' you mean, Rosa, do you not?" "I'm the oldest," answered Rosa. "Yes, I'll try," answered Rosa. asked Agnes. asked Rosa. said Rosa. this fresh, blooming, lovely looking girl! There was a ghastly and disturbed look about poor Tiney's face, and an expression of terrible malignity about her eye, and as she passed the chairs of her little sisters, one screamed loudly and then the other, and when she came near Agnes, it was with great difficulty that she too could resist the inclination to scream with the pain, caused by a terrible pinch from the fingers of Tiney, which left its mark upon her arm for many days. "Oh, dear! asked Agnes, partly rising and looking towards Mrs. Fairland. "Oh, bless you, Miss Agnes!" asked Agnes. she asked. "Oh, lots!" Jessie, can you read?" said Rosa, while Jessie hung her curly head. "And can you write, Rosa?" "No. I can make straight marks," answered Rosa. "He did know his ABC's once, but he's forgot them all." Such a pile of soiled, well-thumbed, and dogs-eared books, as the children produced, Agnes had never seen together, and on opening them she found that the young Fairland's had been exercising their taste for the fine arts, by daubing all the pictures from a six-penny paint-box. There was a "family Bible" in the house to be sure, but the only use to which it had ever been applied, was that of registering the births of the family, and the testimony it bore proved so exceedingly disagreeable to the Misses Fairland, that as Rosa has informed us, they took the liberty one day of erasing it. "He could cure anybody, couldn't He?" "Yes; He was all-powerful," answered Agnes. "Nor I either," said Jessie. And Tiney whispered, "I will try and not hurt them next time." "Every word of it, Franky," said Agnes. The quick eye of a sister's love soon detected that all was not right with Lewie. That happy week was soon over, and the brother and sister parted. "What do you think, Calista? some say that he is a young man, others that he is a widower. "Well, Harrington," said Mr. Tom Wharton to his friend one day, "since your object in bringing me down here with you is accomplished, I must now leave you to your fate. "I can'tâ"I can't stand it, Harrington. Come, Agnes! There was a pleasant breeze, and the little boat flew like a bird over the dancing waves. Agnes, a devoted admirer of nature, was in an ecstasy which she could not conceal, as one beautiful view succeeded another during their sail up the lake; but the other ladies were so much occupied in trying the effect of art, that they had no eye for the beauties of nature. "Why, have you a little girl?" "Yes, two of them," he answered. "Oh, how I doat on children!" "Cousin Agnes, what is the meaning of doat?" "You are, hey, Frank? "Agnes," said he, with a sudden and forced calmness, the words coming slowly from between his white, stiffened lipsâ""Agnes, it isâ"murder!" "Agnes, it is true; your brother is a murderer! For a few moments she could only bury her face in her hands, and rock to and fro and groan. On my word, Agnes, I am not a murderer by intention. Now, Agnes, what shall I do?" do, do let me alone! do leave me in quiet; for I am very, very unhappy!" And hastily, and with great agitation, Agnes left the room. "Cousin Agnes, must I die?" "You are not afraid to die, dear Tiney, are you?" asked Agnes in reply. asked Agnes, in astonishment; for she had, oftener than ever, of late, talked to the failing child of the glories of heaven, and did not doubt that, even with her poor weak mind, she had so trusted by faith in the merits of an all-sufficient Redeemer, that through those merits her spirit would be welcomed to that blissful abode. The Jail. heavy life, wear on, wear on, Â Â Â Would God that thou wert gone." "Every day, dear Agnes, and have been with him some hours each day." "And how does he feel, dear Uncle?" "And how does he feel about theâ"the result, uncle?" "Oh, uncle, how very kind! "It will probably come on in November," her uncle answered. "And by those on the other side, in making strong their cause against him, uncle. Oh, my sister, you deserve a happier lot!" "Don't talk so, dear Lewie!" "But what can you do, Lewie? I am going to be obstinate for once, and take my own course. "Oh, Agnes! this is too, too much!" "Not too much at all, Lewie. said Lewie, pacing up and down the room. "Of my trial, Agnes? Well, I hardly know what to say. "And yet it may be, Agnes! for that, after all, is the great concern." "The eternal future you mean, Agnes. Ah! my sister, the prospect there is darker and more dreary still. "God grant such may not be your fate, dear brother. "And do you think that thought ever for a moment leaves me, Agnes? "No, no, dear sister, pray do not urge it," said he. Agnes, remain in the village if you prefer it, but do not let me see your dear face again till my fate is decided. The Trial. The quick temper of the latter was aroused at once, and he gave a hasty and angry reply. "And is this no palliating circumstance," said Mr. Wâ"â", "that God has given to this young man a naturally fierce and hasty temper, which could not brook that which might be borne more patiently by those whose blood flows more coldly and sluggishly? The question for us to decide is, was it murder? "Sister, thy brother is won by thee."â"MRS. HEMANS. His face was of an ashy paleness, and he seemed irresolute whether to approach her or to leave the room. "And is it possible," said Agnes, "that I have slept so late?" "But oh, aunty!" Yes, I know it is. Agnes, if I could once more look upon the green earth, and the blue sky, and breathe the pure fresh air; and die free." "Agnes," said she, "I have heard something to-day which may possibly cast a ray of hope on Lewie's case yet." "What can it be, dear Grace?" asked Agnes. "Certainly." "Well, it is she. "Oh, blessings on you, Grace! "Father will go with you, Agnes. "Oh, how very, very kind you all are to us!" "And do, Agnes, talk to him just as you have done to me," she said. "He is called a stern man; but he has tender feelings, I can assure you, if the right chord is only touched." "Agnes," said she, "you must see my husband yourself, and say to him all you have said to me. Agnes, do speak as eloquently as you did to me. "He is so young," said she, "only eighteen years old; and yet he must die. But, oh! He hoped to have the pleasure of seeing you, sir." "Go you back to Ruth, my dear young lady. At what time do you leave in the morning, Mr. "Certainly." "Well, then, tell her to lie down to-night, and sleep in peace; and may Heaven bless a sister so devoted, and a friend so true." "He is able and willing to save unto the uttermost," said Agnes. It is a most merciful provision of Providence, that our griefs do not always press upon us as heavily as they do at first, else how could the burden of this life of change and sorrow be borne. HEMANS. "â"Cowper "What do you think, Calista?â"what do you think?" Such a disgrace, you know!" The lady was in mourning, and her veil was down. Oh, he will be here in a few days. He has purchased the place next to us, and is about to build there. What, cousin Betty! Yes, and "alive like to be," till she has finished her century. It is always a season of rejoicing when cousin Emily arrives, with her ever cheerful face, her entertaining conversation for the older ones, and her fund of stories and anecdotes for the children. "What do you mean by that, uncle?" "Well, circumstances do alter cases, don't they, uncle?" It is a story with a fine moral, beautiful and touching in its development. Journal.
