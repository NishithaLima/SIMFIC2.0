Her father, who died before her marriage, had been a sea-captain, and a man of great wealth, and was looked upon as a kind of autocrat, whose opinion was a law and whose friendship was an honor. Yes, there is something hidden, and Hannah knows it, and this it is which turned her hair grey so early, and has made her as queer and reticent as your father. Make good use of what I leave you, and marry one of the Greys. he exclaimed at last, as he arose, and, walking to the window, looked out upon the common, where groups of children were playing. "There is nothing hidden. Oh, it almost broke my heart when he died and left me there alone!" Burton could not remember, for, on the rare occasions when he visited his home he had not been a close observer, and had only been conscious of a desire to shorten his stay as much as possible, and return to his aunt's house, which was much more to his taste. Live with me. Burton went with her to the train, and saw her into the car, and bought her Harper's Monthly, and bade her good-by, and then, in passing out, met and lifted his hat to the Misses Grey, Lucy and Geraldine, who had been visiting in Boston, and were returning to Allington. It is not our purpose to enter into the details of Burton's wooing. "Anything to get away from stupid Allington," she said to her sister Lucy, who she never suspected had been Burton's first choice. He is good-looking, and well-mannered, and has a house and twenty thousand dollars, a good position in the bank, and no bad habits. He was a growing man, and from being clerk in a bank, soon came to be cashier, and then president, and money and friends poured in upon him, and Geraldine's drawing-rooms were filled with the elite of the city. Burton saw no objection to the plan, and readily gave his consent, provided his wife was willing. "Your well must be very deep. she asked, not because she cared, but because she must say something. oh, sister!" "Oh, baby, baby! "God will comfort you, my daughter. Yes, but just now I cannot pray, and I am so desolate." What a summer that was for Hannah, and how swiftly the days went by, while the burden pressed so lightly that sometimes she forgot it for hours at a time, and only remembered it when she saw how persistently her father shrank from the advances of the little boy, who, utterly ignoring his apparent indifference, pursued him constantly, plying him with questions, and sometimes regarding him curiously, as if wondering at his silence. "Da-da," Grey said at last. "Take me, peese; I'se tired." I am tired, too." "Is you sick?" "Is you sorry, then?" On the contrary there came into his eyes a look of horror as he exclaimed: "Shut me in the bedroom! and why can I never take him in my arms or lay my hands upon him lest they should leave a stain?" Grey had conquered and was free to do what he pleased with the old man, who became his very slave, going wherever Grey liked, whether up the steep hill-side in the rear of the house or down upon the pond near by, where the white lilies grew and where there was a little boat in which the old man and the child spent hours together, during the long summer afternoons. Grey not go." "Some time Grey will know, for I must tell him, and he will help me." It is not mine; it would be stealing, to take a penny of it." He was three years younger than Lucy, who, having been petted so long as the only child, looked somewhat askance at the brother who had come to interfere with her, and as he grew older, and developed that wonderful beauty and winning sweetness for which he was so remarkable, the demon of jealousy took possession of the little girl, who felt at times as if she hated him for the beauty she envied so much. "Oh, I wish he was blind!" And, as if in answer to her wish, an accident occurred not long after, which darkened forever the eyes which had caused her so much annoyance. "Oh, Robbie, Robbie, you must not be blind! Try, Robbie. It 'marts some yet, but bime by I see 'oo. "There is something I must tell her. Try to be happy, and never forsake poor Robbie." On the contrary, the hectic flush on his cheek deepened daily, his hands grew thinner and paler, and the eyelids seemed to droop more heavily over the sightless eyes. "Oh, Robbie, Robbie, don't!" Oh, it will be such joy!â"no night, no blindness, no pain, and you with me again as you have been here, only there, I shall be the guide, and lead you through the green pastures beside the still waters, where never-fading flowers are blooming sweeter than the orange blossoms near our window." What shall I do when my expiatory work is finished?" Robin repeated, questioningly. "Much, much. "Yes, sister, you have made my life so full of happiness that, darkened as it is, I would like to cling to it longer, though I know heaven is so much better." "What is the picture?" Lucy said, and her face was whiter than the one above her. Give me your hand till I reach the river-bank where the angels are waiting for me, I can see them and the beautiful city over the dark river, though I can't see you; but I shall in heaven, and I am almost there. Good-by, good-by, Lucy." I must tell how I hated you and the pretty baby ways which made you so attractive, and when I climbed up in the chair after the lumps of sugar and saw the cup of Cayenne pepper, and you standing below me with wide-open eyes and outstretched hands, asking me to give, the devil look possession of me and whispered that now was my chance to ruin those eyes looking up so eagerly at me. "You know the rest, how from that moment he never looked on me or any one again; but you do not, cannot know the anguish and remorse which filled my soul, when I realized what I had done. He was glad, too, for the snow and as the express train sped swiftly on, and he watched it from the window, falling in blinding sheets and covering all the hill-tops, he thought what fun it would be on the morrow to drive his Aunt Lucy's bays over to the farm-house after his Aunt Hannah, whom he would take for a long drive across the country, and frighten with the rapidity with which the bays would skim along. And, my eyes what a blizzard! "Now, father, jump in, and let me shut the door. Holloa, mother! Isn't it jolly here? What a heathenish hour! "Yes, she wrote me to that effect," Burton replied, "but she is easily alarmed, and so I did not attach much importance to it. Burton Jerrold, respected by every one, and, what to his narrow mind was better still, he was looked upon as an aristocrat of the bluest type. he asked. He is very anxious to see Grey, but I doubt if he will even let him into the bedroom." "Grey, are you crazy to think of going out in this storm?" I can go, can't I, Aunt Lucy?" I'll risk Tom," Grey said. He is not like you. He is grand and high, and ashamed of his old father, but he is my son, and I must see him once more. He will be up on Thanksgiving Day, and I shall live till then. Her father was not as well that morning. "Grey, the boy with the big blue eyes which look so straight at you that I used sometimes to wonder if he did not see into my heart and know what I was hiding?" "Grey, the little boy who would sit on that bench in the woodshed, and kick the floor until I sweat at every pore with fear, and whom I would not touch till he captured my hands, and held them in his soft, warm ones, and kissed them, too, my wicked old hands, kissed by Grey's baby lips. But hark, what's that? Go, child, quickly, and not let them in here." "What is it, auntie?" "It was enough to kill one with laughing. how much-ee, much-ee?' I think I have improved some; don't you, auntie." but no, you cannot, it is so dark! Can he see nothing, sure?" Very rapidly Grey talked of his travels, and the wonders beyond the sea. "But, after all, America is best," he said, "and I am glad I am an American. No. Joel Rogers, that was the name, and he had a sister, Elizabeth. You two, and no more. Be good to her, Grey, when I am gone; be good to Hannah. "Oh, oh! My boy, my boy, you hurt me!" Is your hand sore?" "Come, Grey, I think it is time we were off. To-day is all we can call our own, and I will bless my boy to-day. Kneel down, Grey, and let me put both hands on your head." Good-by;" and stooping, he kissed the white forehead and quivering lips, around which a smile of peace was setting. Then, he left the room, never dreaming that it was good-by forever. Of her past life she never spoke, and of her family seldom. Her father and mother were dead; she had two brothers, both well enough in their way, but wholly unlike each other, she had once told Lucy Grey, whom she had always liked, and with whom she was more intimate than with any one else in Allington, unless it were Hannah Jerrold. I'm no better, no worse for them." "Not a bit of it," Grey answered, merrily. ejaculated Miss McPherson, with an upward toss of the chin. "No, indeed," was Grey's reply. "No, I did not even see them play. Never, never play for money so long as you live. "No, madam; at first I did not like him at all. "But he insulted me first," Grey replied, and Miss McPherson insisted: "Tell it, Grey, and do not omit anything, because I am his aunt. Tell it exactly as it was. he retorted, tapping the ground with the tip of his boot.' Why, I am Neil McPherson, an Eton boy, and my father is the Hon. Where did you learn boxing?' "'I never learned it,' I told him. "He believed me, and said 'Reely, is that so?' What is Archie like? So, then, what did you think of Archie? "He takes it from his father, rather than his mother. Then why not call her Betsey, if that is her name?" "No, of course not. I think it horrid, but if I was christened Betsey, no power on earth could turn me into a Bessie; but go on and tell me about her," and she turned to Mrs. Geraldine, who continued: "She has her mother's wonderful beauty, with all its refinement of her father, and such a sweet expression that you feel like kissing her. "'Mamma, mamma, please,' she would say. "And her father, was he fond of her?" I asked, and she replied: "'Yes, but they never call me that. I think she is mean, don't you?' I asked, and she replied: "'At the Queen's Hotel, but it is awful expensive there, and papa says we can't afford it much longer. I asked, and the child answered me: "'Lord Hardy, mamma's friend. He is very rich and very nice. I asked, and she said, while a shadow came over her face: "'We couldn't if we didn't have one small room on the top floor, where I sleep on the lounge. And, as she gazed she thought: "Yes, Grey was right. "Your aunt, Miss BETSEY McPHERSON. Allington, Mass. "P.S. He says your father is very bad." Come at once, and come alone." He was sure of it, and knew why Hannah had written "come alone." He was there when Miss Hannah came home and found him. The Rev. she asked, as she hastened to open the hall-door, which admitted such a gust of wind that she came near shutting it in Sam's face. No, no; I have not so learned Christ. Please bring me my coat, Martha, and my boots, and the little communion service." I consider it an insult to his Creator and to you, too." "He must be crazy! It is I, Hannah, and Sam is in the wood-shed." Who should take it away, when no one knows but ourselves? Get into bed, father; you are shivering with cold." he exclaimed, as a gust of wind went shrieking past the window. "It was only the wind. Her father was very quiet now; he was falling asleep, and sinking on her knees beside the bed, the wretched woman moaned piteously: "Oh, my Father in heaven, how long must I bear this burden which to-night presses so heavily? Help me, help me, for I am so weak and sad. Poor old Rover, lying under the snow. And light a candle, Sam; three candles! Any word, I mean?" Sam suited her, and his answer to her question was characteristic of him. "No, I don't hear nothin' it says, only it screams like a panther in a fit," and Sam deliberately lighted the three candles, and placed them on the table, while Hannah drew a hard wooden chair to the stove, and putting her feet upon the hearth, clasped her hands around her knees, and sat there till she was thoroughly warm, and her nerves were quieted. I know it. I must see him before I die. Burton and the minister, no one else; not even the boy Grey; he must not come, for, Hannah, I am going to tell!" "What, father?" I must do it. It would only give him unnecessary pain. Burton stands well with men; high in the world, but he is not like you; he would never have done what you have, and I want him to know that there is a sacrifice which ennobles one more than all the honors of the world, and I want Mr. Sanford to know why I could not go forward and ratify my baptismal vows, as he has so often urged me to do, thinking me obstinate in my refusal; and I wish to hear him say that he believes I am forgiven; that Christ will receive me, even me, aâ"Oh, Hannah, I can not say that word. But hurry, Hannah. Tell them to come quickly, Burton and the minister, not Grey." It would be safe with Mr. Sanford, while her proud brother would die a thousand deaths sooner than reveal it; but, oh, how cruelly he would be hurt, and how he would shrink from the story, and blame her that she allowed it to be told, especially to the clergymanâ"and she might perhaps prevent that yet. If I can be of any comfort to you or your father, I should be very sorry not to come. The Hon. Burton Jerrold liked his comfort and ease, and as he was far from easy or comfortable, he made his sister feel it by his manner, if not by his words. he asked, and Hannah replied: "Yes, he is very bad. He says he is going to die, and I believe it. He will not last the night out, and of course I must send for you, and he insisted that Mr. Sanford should come too." "Yes, certainly; I am glad he did," the clergyman rejoined, thrusting his hands into his coat-pocket. "I could not help it, brother," Hannah said, mildly. "Yes, Hannah," Mr. Sanford said, "you can trust me; be the secret one of life or death, it is safe with me as with you." "Wait, Sam," she said. Her father had both Burton's hands in his, and was crying like a little child. How old was he, Hannah? How old was Burton when the terrible thing happened?" "Three whole days," he said. Burton started quickly, and glanced at his sister with a look of amazed inquiry. Oh, Grey! Burton cried, in a choking voice; "for pity's sake, have done, and tell me what you mean! I am not afraid of the snow. Oh, Grey! "I am not to blame," he said, "and people will not think so if they know, which they never will, for father will not tell, nor Mr. Sanford either; but I shall always know, and life will never be the same to me again." "You helped. Burton asked, in alarm, and his father replied: "Make restitution in some way to the friends of the man I killed, if she can find them." "There is no one there, and Sam is sleeping soundly in the room beyond," she said, as she returned to her father's side, and taking her place by him passed her arm around him and supported and reassured him, while he told the story of that awful night, a story which the author will tell in her own words rather than in those of the dying man, who introduced a great deal of matter irrelevant to the case. He was a little, cross eyed, red-haired, wiry man, with a blunt, sharp way of speaking, but was very popular with the citizens of Allington, to whom he sold such small articles as he could conveniently carry in a bundle upon his back; needles, pins, thread, pencils, matches, thimbles, cough lozengers, Brandreth's pills, handkerchiefs, ribbons, combs, and sometimes Irish laces and Balbriggans formed a part of his heterogeneous stock, which was varied from time to time to suit the season, or the wants of his customers. Between Peter Jerrold and the peddler there was a strong friendship, and the two often sat into the small hours of the night, while the latter told marvelous tales of his wild Welsh country, which he held above all other lands, and to which, the last time he was seen in Allington, he said he was about to return. You and that brute of a dog, whom I will kill and so have him out of the way! Here, you Rover, come here!" Isn't it enough that you have killed him!" and she pointed shudderingly to the inanimate form upon the floor. You do not want your poor father hung! Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do? He was going to Europe. He was merely stunned with the magnitude and suddenness of his crime, and the natural fear of its detection. I must hide it, bury it, and you must help and swear on the Bible not to tell so long as I live. "Oh, father, father," Hannah cried, in an agony of entreaty; "do not ask me to help! He was very unreasonable and aggravating, and called us both liars. Go, father; now, and leave him where he lies. Go, father." he answered. Think, father, think!" Have mercy, have mercy! Oh, help me! Oh, my heavenly Father, have mercy! "Oh, Rover, Rover, don't!" He was only a dog, but his sympathy was reassuring to the wretched man, who looked up, and with a faint smile, said to his daughter: "Rover forgives and pities me. On the table beside them lay the watch, the leathern bag, and the box which had belonged to the deceased. "Oh, how lovely she is," Hannah said, showing the picture to her father. What shall we do?" "Oh, father," Hannah cried in terror. I would not mention you, or that I had a father. "Yes, she might, but not the law. He was growing so excited with this new fear that his daughter shrank from him in alarm, and at last yielding to his importunities took another oath of secrecy, which doomed the blue-eyed woman in Wales to a life of poverty, if such now were her portion. "But what shall we do with this money?" What should I do without you! What shall I do when you are gone?" It might have been better if I had told at first, as you advised. Oh, if I had done it. I think he will, but I can never join his church with this crime on my soul." You are not in fault: no one can blame you." Oh, Hannah, why did you let him tell me? Yes, I believe I am. It is not so bad as you think. He will never tell," and the dark eyes looked for one moment at the man whom, in her excitement and forgetfulness, she had almost called by his Christian name, and who, in response to the call and the look, went to her side, and laying his hand upon her head, said, solemnly: "As heaven is my witness, what I have heard here to-night shall never pass my lips." he added, in a tone of alarm, as if he had lost her. I know it. "And Burton, too!" "And Burton, my son; God bless him. Burton Jerrold, of Boston. He was standing before the kitchen fire, with Hannah near him, holding the warm muffler he was to tie around his neck. Twelve years after that summer, the memory of which was still half joy, half pain, he had married Miss Martha Adams, of Cambridge, because a mutual friend had told him he ought to do so, that a bachelor clergyman was never as useful as a married one, and that Miss Martha, a maiden lady of thirty-five, was eminently fitted to fulfill the duties of a rector's wife, for she came from a long line of clergy and for years had run the Sunday-school, and the sewing society, and the church generally in the parish to which she belonged. and she replied, "No, never," he turned away, and, walking back across the fields to his own home, wrote to his friend in Walpole, signifying his readiness to be introduced to Miss Martha Adams. I am not cold." "But you have taken cold. Why then did he send for you on such a night, and why did you stay so long?" Please don't talk to me any more. He was as white as ashes, and with all her better, softer nature roused, for Martha was at heart a very good woman, she helped him to a chair, and bathed his head in alcohol, and rubbed his hands, and did not question him again. What is there to restore?" I had no idea of this," Burton said, and she replied: "Yes, I know you would, but I did not like to do it, for fear you would think me extravagant and wonder what I did with so much. "You, Hannahâ"you?" Burton said, gazing at the pale-faced, frail-looking woman, who had done the work of a man rather than ask money of him who sometimes spent more on one large party than she did in a whole year, and who said to him, with a sad smile: "Yes; I have spaded the garden, and planted the corn in the field back of the hill, where no one could see me, and have helped Sam get in the hay, though I never attempted to mow; but I did lay up a bit of stone wall which had tumbled down, I have done what I could." But this must go no further. He is sensitive, very, and proud of his name. It would kill him to know what we do." "No, brother, it would hurt him, but not kill him." But whoever she is or was, she is not like this now; she is old or dead. He was not sorry for his father's death, but he was willing, nay glad, that she should think so, for he could not tell her of the load of shame from which he should never be free. he asked himself, as he remembered all her pride of blood, and birth, and family. Burton would not soften the crime even in thought, though he knew that had his father been arrested at the time, he could only have been convicted of manslaughter, and possibly not of that. "But he never will know," he said to himself, "Hannah will keep her promise, and I do not fear Mr. Sanford, though I'd give half my fortuneâ"yes, allâ"if he had not been told. Grey had not slept at all, for the dreadful words, "I killed a man, and buried him under my bed," were continually ringing in his ears, while the ghost of the murdered man seemed present with him, urging him to vengeance for the wrong, until at last, when he could bear it no longer, he stretched his hands out into the darkness, and cried: "What is it you want with me? I am not to blame, but if there is any thing I can do to make it right, I'll do it, when I am man. Now, go away and do not torment me so." Please God, grant that my Aunt Hannah is a good woman still. He was not surprised when Lucy came and told him his grandfather was dead. Please, God, have mercy on him. Oh, I can not bear it. We will bear it together," but when he remembered that his grandfather had said: "that he was not to know," he restrained himself, and said very quietly: "Grandpa is dead. Her nerves were not equal to it and she should only be in the way, she said. Try and not feel so badly. He looks so calm and peaceful and happy, just as you never saw him look." Oh, Grey!" "I want you to remember him as he looks now, so different from what he was in life." "There can be no mistake," he said, "I was with him a few hours before he died. I know you are in heaven." Burton whispered to his sister, who answered: "You know I have not." "Send for her and bring her here, where she can have enough to eat. he answered. Give her all the mince pie she can eat, and all the griddle cakes. he asked his Aunt Lucy, when she was alone with him. he asked; and she told him as nearly as she could remember. "Send for him. "Don't think I'm awful good, or going to join the church. It is not that, but I want to see the minister before Aunt Hannah comes back." I know he is safe." Yes, she is the best, the truest, the purest woman who ever lived. How old are you, auntie?" You are different from them both, though more like Aunt Lucy, whose face is the sweetest I ever saw except yours, which looks as if Christ had put His hand hard upon it and left His impress there." I was in the kitchen, and heard aboutâ"about that under the floor!" "I wanted to come with father, but he said no, and so I went to my room but could not go to bed, for I knew grandpa was dying, and I wished to see him, and I stole out the back way, and came across the fields and into the kitchen, where I stood warming myself by the stove and heard you all talking in the next room. "Oh, Grey, my boy, no, no," Hannah cried aghast. "Mr. "Not of that," Grey said. And, now, tell me about it. "I am not a bit afraid of the house now, and would as soon sleep in grandpa's room as anywhere," he said to Hannah, as they sat together in the evening, and then they talked of her future until Grey was old enough to take care of her, as he meant to do. he asked, and Hannah replied: "I don't know yet what I shall do, I shall let your father decide for me." "You might live with us in Boston," Grey said. You can have any one live with you whom you choose, and I will supply you with plenty of money. "Yes, she looks as if a big slice of plum pudding or mince pie would do her good! He was with us there, and sometimes walked with me when Archie was not inclined to go out. He is very nice, and Archie is very fond of him, while to Bessie and me he is like a brother." "Archie's friend! "No, they may go to destruction their own way. She will grow up like her mother, marry some fool, have her friend and brother dangling after her, and smuggle dinners and lunches for her children up in the attic. "I wish my hands were white, and that I could wear diamond rings like the ladies at the George," she continued; "and sometime I will, if they are only shams. the girl thought, and in watching the carriage as it drove toward the house she relaxed her vigilance so far that a huge blue bottle-fly which had been skirting around the spot, for some time, alighted squarely upon Archie's nose, and roused him from his slumber. Lady Jane looks very proud," Daisy said, and Archie rejoined: "She looks as she is then. "She thinks the world made only for her and the baby Neil," Archie said, "and Dorothy thinks so too. I wouldn't!" It would not hurt you one bit." "You know I did not mean you to be any of these," the girl answered, a little indignantly; "but you might do something. You can go to London and be a clerk in that big store, Marshall & Snellgrove's. It would never do for a McPherson to be in trade. It won't hurt you to work any more than any body else, and you'll have to do something. "Upon my word, I did not know you had so much vim. You are a regular little spit-fire," Archie said, regarding her intently; then after a pause, he added: "What am I going to do? he answered, with a comical look at Daisy, on whom it was lost, for she was admiring the smart cap and pink ribbons of the maid, who said: "If you are Mr. Archibald, your father wishes to see you. "Archie!" "Yes, Hugh," he said, "I like the boy. Now I have a son, which makes a difference. Betsey is very peculiar in her ideas, and would as soon apprentice him to a shoemaker as anything else. Keep him from that, whatever you do." "Why not require a promise from him to that effect? Oh, Dora! "But what shall I do?" "There will be some way provided. But promise, and I shall die happier." If he did not choose to come, or her brother did not choose to send him on account of any foolish pride and prejudice against labor, then he might take care of him or the boy might starve for all of her. He was a great, good-natured, easy-going, indolent fellow, popular with everybody, and very fond, and very proud of, and very dependent upon her, with no grain of jealousy in his nature. Twelve pounds are enough for one day," she said, and depositing her gains in her leather bag, she took Archie's arm and left the room, followed by scores of admiring eyes, while many an eager question was asked as to who the lovely English girl could be. "Your wife!" I was in Bangor last year, at the George Hotel, and heard your name mentioned. I think it a streak of luck to have met you here, where I know nobody and nobody knows me, I hope we may be friends." Yours sincerely, "Oh, Archie!" "No; more like you, Ted. Dress you in her clothes, and you might pass for her." "By Jove! I see. Nobody had challenged him or his age as he passed in with Daisy, who was well known by this time, and around whom and her companion, a crowd of curious ones gathered and watched them as they played, cautiously at first, for that was Daisy's style; then as Ted's Irish blood began to tingle with excitement, more recklessly, until he whispered to her: "Play high. "Nobody but your husband, upon my soul," Ted whispered, after glancing back at Archie, who, with folded arms and a cloud on his brow, stood watching the game and longing to take his wife away. "Nobody but your husband, who looks black as his Satanic majesty. "Play high, and it's meself'll make good all you lose. Daisy said, as with her husband she went through the great rooms, whose only ornament consisted in the warm fires on the hearth and the pots of chrysanthemums and late roses which Dorothy had put here and there by way of brightening the house up a bit and making the home-coming more cheerful for the young people. "I'll tell you what, Archie," she said one day. Let's name the baby for her, and so get some of her filthy lucre." I think that is a horrid name." she asked at last. "No, Heaven forbid!" "Don't you like my mamma?" the child said. Where do you live?" What shall I tell her for you?" she asked, rather sharply, and Bessie, who had commenced the rubbing process again and was looking at her hands, replied: "I want a turquois ringâ"five stones, with a pearl in the center; real, too. Try and be good and truthful and real, and stick to your father, and sometime, maybe, you'll see me again." He was so tired and so ashamed of the life he ledâ"now here, now there, now on the first floor, now on the fifth floor back, now plenty now penury and absolute want, according to Daisy's luck. I must say, though, that it is very beautiful, and the old thing did herself justice when she bought it. Look, Archie, it fits me perfectly!" and she slipped it onto her finger, where it remained; for, as she said, Bessie could not wear it then, and it might as well do somebody some good. It is a shame you have never met them. Lady Jane is rather peculiar, but a very good woman, and you ought to know her." Daisy said. "Very well," was Mrs. Smithers' reply. But this time there was a change, and when Lady Oakley arrived with her maid, and her poodle dog, and her ear trumpet, for she was very deaf, she was assigned a room in one of the wings, her hostess telling her apologetically that she had thought it well to put the McPhersons together as they would thus get on better, and she was so anxious for Lady Jane to like Mrs. Archie, the sweetest, most amiable of women. "Say, isn't it nice?" she continued, and then coming into the room and wiping his face with the towel as he came, Archie replied: "Nice enough, yes; but I don't know what we are going to do when we have to leave here, I tell you, it makes a chap feel mighty mean not to have a shilling in his pocket, and that's just my case. In short, we are nothing but impostors, both of us." You can pay me some time when your ship comes in, and really I have more than I know what to do with." Daisy, on the contrary, was wholly unmoved. I must not wear my paste diamonds, for though I've no idea Lady Jane can tell them from the real, she would think them far too expensive for people in our circumstances, and wonder how I got them." Lady Jane was very tired, and hot, and dusty, for she had come from Edinburgh that day, and she glanced around her luxurious apartment with a feeling of comfort and relief, as she issued her orders to her maid, Lydia, and talked to her husband. Was her father an iron monger, or what?" "There, that will do for me; I can finish the rest myself. He was a year older than Grey, with a dark, handsome face, a pleasant smile, and winsome ways when he chose to be agreeable. He was the idol of his mother, who saw no fault in him whatever, and who had commenced already to plan for him a brilliant marriage, or at least a marriage of money, for her own income was not large, and that of her husband smaller still. Lady Jane had heard much of Daisy's exploits, and as the stories concerning her were greatly exaggerated, she looked upon her, if not actually an abandoned woman, as one whose good name was hopelessly tarnished, and she never wished to see either her face or that of her child. "There is nothing to excuse," Daisy began, in perfectly well-bred tones, "the mistake was natural. and she looked steadily at her visitor, who with a slight bridling of her long neck, bowed in the affirmative, never doubting that the young person before her was fully her equal, notwithstanding the plainness of her dress, every detail of which she took in at a glance and mentally pronounced perfect. was her first query. I think I will go down, as it is nearly dinnertime," and bowing stiffly, she went down the stairs, every nerve quivering with insulted dignity, and not quite certain whether she heard a smothered laugh or not from the room, where Daisy was shaking with laughter at what she termed the old cat's discomfiture. his uncle asked, regarding him steadily. We ought to have waited; but she is beautiful, and greatly admired." I hear of you everywhere I hope you have not resorted to the gaming-table?" "Your wife plays, though!" "How much have you now?â"how much money, I mean?" "Just one shilling; and Daisy has, ten. "Oh, I am so glad!" the child exclaimed; "for now we are real, and not impostors, are we?" "Not in the sense of not having any money," he replied, but there was a sad, anxious expression on his face, as he looked down upon the little girl beside him, and thought of the future and what it might bring to her. "Oh, I'd like it so much," Bessie said, "but I am afraid mamma would not. She hates Stoneleigh, it's so dull." "But you and I might live there. They are sure to be there in their gorgeous attire, and Blanche will have her poodle-dog." "No, I won't," Bessie said, humbly, for something in Neil's tone hurt her; then, as she saw him consulting his watch, she said: "Oh, Neil, can't I walk with you just a little way? You could not have been alone," Blanche said to him in an undertone. "No, I was not alone," he replied, with great frankness. "I was with the prettiest girl in London, or out of it, either." When it was over, and the guests were gone. Lady Jane turned fiercely upon her son and asked what had kept him so late. "Cousin Bessie," he answered, "She is in the city with her father, at No. Lady Jane replied, with ineffable scorn. "No," Neil answered her. I know most of them." "There they come! "Neil was angry, I know. She meant to show her companion how respectable she was, even if her dress, which she was sure he had inspected critically, was poor and out of date, and she was not prepared for his sudden start, as he repeated: "Mr. Archibald McPherson, of Bangor! It is a species of insanity, I think." I think she has the loveliest face I ever saw, with one exception," and he looked straight at the young girl whom he had wounded, hoping this implied compliment might atone. It is not in him. I am no worse than scores of women, except that I am poor and play from necessity, while they do it for pastime. If he did, I would shoot him as I would a dog. I know my own business, and can protect my own reputation." She bears a charmed hand, I think, or she would not be so successful." Truly, she had much to learn. "You know my cousin Blanche, of course," he said to her next. He was so much to her; something more than a brother, something less than a lover, for she was too young to think of such an ending to her friendship for him, and her heart beat rapidly and her lips quivered as she arose on the instant to go. "Come, father, I think we have staid long enough. What a pity!" Good-by," and she gave him her ungloved hand, which, though small and plump and well formed, showed that it was not a stranger to work. Good-by again." It sounds well, and what a sensation she would make in society. "I thought you once told me she was very pretty," she said: "but I think her a fright in that dowdy dress, and bare-headed, too! Did it to show her hair, no doubt! These he ordered sent to Bessie, at No. "Why, Jack!" he exclaimed; "I thought you were in Ireland! "It was really too ridiculous, to see her standing there waving her handkerchief with her head bare to show her abundant hair, and that old linen gown, which must have seen some years' service. I was intensely mortified to have our friends see her, and so was Neil." "Oh, you did like it, then? They are stopping atâ"" He hesitated, and looked at Neil, who, grateful for his defense of Bessie, unhesitatingly replied: "No. But this gift from Neil, her cousin, she surely might keep, for her father said so, and, young-girl-like, she was admiring herself, or rather the hat, before the glass, when Neil himself came in. "Hallo, Dot," he said, coming quickly to her side. Why, you are sweet and fresh this morning as a rose from the old Stoneleigh garden," and the tall young man stooped and kissed the blushing girl two or three times before she could withdraw herself from him. "Why, Bess," he continued, "what a lump of dignity you are this morning! she asked, and Neil detested himself because he did not at once offer to take her and her father for the coveted drive. he asked himself many times, deciding finally that he could not face his fashionable friends, and, more than all, his mother and Blanche, with these country cousinsâ"Archie, in his threadbare coat, and Bessie, in her linen gown, with the big puffs at the top of the sleeves. "Hallo, Hallo!" "The same which brought you, I dare say," Jack replied. Jack. You are as goodâ"yes, better than most of the fellows in our set, butâ"" He hesitated, and Jack rejoined: "But what? Go on." "By Jove, I will speak out!" "And I am the housemaid; I wash the dishes and lay the cloth and sweep and dust, and an apron keeps my dress clean," Bessie had answered him, laughingly, and when she came to London she brought her best apron with her, and after Neil was gone put it on and commenced her task of darning. "I wish Neil had sent you a coat instead of that dress to me. I would buy a lot of things, but first of all I would have a drive in the park. He is very kind in a way, when it costs him nothing, but he would never sacrifice his comfort or his feelings for you or me. It would cost him nothing to take us for a drive, for the carriage is his mother's, but you couldn't hire him to go round that park with us; he has that false pride, more common in women than in men, which would keep him from it. You were fifteen last March. You are very beautiful, and Neil McPherson knows it, and if you had a fortune he might seek to be more than your cousin; but as it is, don't attach much importance to what he says and does, or be disappointed at what he does not do." You are very beautiful, and Neil McPherson knows it, and if you had a fortune he might seek to be more than your cousin, but as it is don't attach much importance to what he says and does or be disappointed at what he does not do." What a lovely woman she will make." "I see you are. "Then Neil has not asked you, and you will go with me?" You are giving my little girl a greater pleasure than you can ever guess." "Why, Bessie," her father said, "what is the matter? "I do, I do," she sobbed; then, with a quick, impatient movement she dashed the tears from her eyes which shone like stars as she lifted them bravely to Jack Trevellian and said, with a tinge of pride in her lone: "I should enjoy the drive more than anything else in the world, and it was kind in you to ask us; but, Mr. Trevellian, you don't know what it would be to you to be seen there with father and meâ"he in his darned coat and I in this gown, the best I have here, or anywhere, for summer; and then, my hat; the ribbons are all faded and poor, just as we are, dear father and I;" and as she talked she stepped to her father's side and wound her arms around his neck. Quite a giant, in fact. She will make a lovely woman, and somebody's heart will ache on her account one of these days." "I wish I could," Neil growled, and then he relapsed into silence and scarcely spoke again until they returned to Grosvenor Square. he asked, pantingly, and fanning himself with his soft hat as they left the gloomy building, and, after looking at the spot where Ann Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey were beheaded, went back to the office where they dismissed their guide. "Why didn't you then? I would rather have gone with you," Bessie said, beginning to relent at once toward the handsome, good-for-nothing Neil, who had his arm around her, and was looking into her face with his dark, expressive eyes. "Why didn't I?" he answered. "Don't speak of it, I beg; it is so very little, I only wish there was really something I could do to prove my willingness to serve you," he said. He was not an inveterate gambler, though he had lost and won large sums at Monte Carlo and Baden Baden, when the tables were open there, and, like most Englishmen, he never played whist that something was not staked; it gave zest to the game, which to him would be very insipid without it: but Bessie's eyes could have made him face the cannon's mouth, if need be, and he said to her at once: "I promise that, too. Who is Neil's friend, I wonder? He served me just right, and we are great friends now. He was at Eton with me and at Oxford, too, and took the wind out of all our sails in both places. I hear she is at Monte Carlo still. "Oh, Neil! oh, mother!" He, of course, will surrender to you at once, and he is worthy of you. "But he is greatly changed from what he used to be," she said. I think there must be some woman concerned in the change. "Oh, mother, please don't talk like that," Bessie said, thinking to herself that she could tell, if she would, why he did not play as formerly, and feeling a great throb of gladness that he was keeping his promise to her. You are very lovely to-night in your finery. "Very glad for Neil, but I do not think I want that American here, too. They are great friends, I believe," Archie said. "No, I shall not," Bessie rejoined, tapping the floor impatiently with her boot, whose shabbiness French blacking could not wholly conceal, "I shall be civil to him, of course, as Neil's friend, but I would rather he did not come, spoiling everything. As I told you once in London, so I tell you now. Oh, that if! What a big one it is in my case. He was in very high spirits, it seemed to her, as she listened to his gay badinage and laughter. He was always helping us out of scrapes at school. "Your father has nothing to give you; absolutely nothing, and you can yourself judge, how, with your tastes and habits, you will like living at Stoneleigh with two meals a day, as I hear they sometimes do, blacking your own boots and building your own fires." He was too dependent upon what wealth would bring him to throw it away for one girl, even if that girl were Bessie, whom he loved with all the intensity of his selfish natureâ"loved so much that for an hour or so after his interview with his mother, he balanced the two questions, Blanche with ten thousand a year, or Bessie with nothing. "There is Grey Jerrold. He is just the man for Bessie to fall in love with if she could see him, and I'll bring that about." "What if she should take the bits in her teeth and throw me overboard?" He was sure of it when he reached Stoneleigh and saw her with the brightness on her face and the sparkle in her eye as she welcomed him. "Yes, she is just suited to America, where, I believe, the women all wear aprons and wash their own dishes," Neil thought, as he watched her with a strange feeling in his heart of pain and happiness; happiness that for a few days at least she was his to look at, to love, to caress; pain that the days were so few and so short when he must leave her. "I want you to get yourself up stunningly," he said, "so as to make a good first appearance. how I dread it, and you, too!" she continued, shaking her head at the imaginary Grey, who stood before her mind's eye, black-eyed, black-whiskered, black-faced, and a very giant in proportions, as she fancied all Americans to be. It would indeed have been a very censorious, fault-finding man who could have seen aught amiss in the beautiful young girl, plain as her dress might be, and for answer to her question, Neil stood up and kissed her, saying as he did so: "He will think you perfect, though I don't like the ribbon, I don't like any color about you except your hair and eyes. Between the man of twenty-three and the boy of fourteen, who had knelt upon the snow in the leafless woods and asked God to forgive him for his grandfather's sin, and had pledged himself to undo as far as was possible the wrong to others that sin had caused, there was the difference of nine years of growth, and culture, and experience, and knowledge of the world; but otherwise the boy and the man were the same, for as the Grey of fourteen had been frank, and truthful, and generous, and wholly unselfish, with a gentleness in his nature like that of a tender, loving woman, so was the Grey of twenty-three whom we last saw upon the steamer which was taking him away from home and the lonely woman watching so tearfully upon the wharf, and feeling that with his going her joyless life was made more desolate. He was in Europe for study, he said, and not for society, and he devoted himself to his books with an energy and will which put him at the head of his class in Eton, and won him an enviable reputation for scholarship at Oxford, where he had now been for nearly four years, and where he intended to remain until his Aunt Lucy, and possibly his Aunt Hannah, crossed the sea and joined him for an extended tour. On the contrary, she would, if necessary, ask him to hold her baby for a moment, and the child would go to him unhesitatingly, so great was the mesmeric power he exercised over his fellow-creatures. I think I told you that Mr. Archie McPherson is awfully poor," he explained apologetically as he saw Grey pull his fur cap over his ears, for the wind was blowing a gale and drifting the snow in their faces. "Not a bit of it," Bessie replied. One to the north will suit me, if there is such a one. "There is a big chamber to the north, cold enough for anybody, but Miss Bessie got this ready for you. She will not like you to change. He was very reassuring; and wholly deceived by his manner, Dorothy departed and left him to himself. What a lovely face she has, and how it reminds me of somebodyâ"I don't know whom, unless it is Aunt Hannah, whose face I seemed to see right side by side with Bessie. "Oh, Dorothy, why did you allow it, and what must he think of us?" "I could not help myself, darling, for he would have his way," Dorothy replied. You do not know how cold that north chamber is, and we cannot warm it if we try, the chimney smokes so badly. You might let the fire go down in mâ", in the other room, if the heat affects you. You are almost the first I have ever seen." "Allington, in Massachusetts; about forty miles or so from Boston. "Sorry, sir, I cannot make you a fire. Grey had wondered when he ought to present his Christmas gift, and glanced around the room to see if Neil's was visible; but it was not, and he concluded to wait the progress of events. "Hallo, Jerrold, and Mack, you both here? Why, you are the longest-winded fellow I ever knew." "But you will have to smoke cubebs," Grey rejoined. I think them rather too free and easy for strangers, and quite too familiar with you. "But it is jolly here," Grey said, rubbing his hands, and holding them to the bright fire. I think we will draw cuts for her; the longest wins," and he proceeded to arrange three slips of paper in his hand. "Be fair, now. "Your turn next, Trevellian. I think it exceedingly pretty." "The ribbon is mine, and I claim my own!" Whist was a stupid game anyway, and he never had any luck. Good-by," and with a pressure of the hand he had held in his all the time he was talking, he was gone, and Bessie felt that something very bright and strong and helpful had suddenly been taken from her, and nothing left in its place but Neil, who, by contrast with the American, did not seem to her quite the same Neil as before. You are not in earnest! You do not mean what you say. You cannot want me. I must take care of my father, and thenâ"there isâ"there isâ"oh, Neil, I am sorry if it is wrong to say itâ"there is my mother!" I am not one quarter as good as Grey Jerrold, or even Jack Trevellian." I would give the world if I possessed it. You are as good as engaged to her; you said so in your letter." You do love me, I am sure, and you will love me more when you know all I mean to do. She means me to marry Blanche, and will be very angry for a time, and perhaps refuse to give me my present allowance, so we may be very poor; but that I shall not mind if you are with me. Poverty will be sweet if shared with you, who, I know, are not afraid of it." "No, Neil," Bessie said, getting her face free from his hands, "I am not afraid of poverty, and I do love you; butâ"" "But what?" "No, Neil. It is not in the McPherson blood to work, and I dare not be the first to break the rule." "Don't you think Grey Jerrold would work if he were poor?" He was taking his consent too much for granted, and Bessie did not like it, and said to him: "No, Neil; it is not settled for sure. He was not fond of study, and greatly preferred his idle, pleasant life at home, breakfasting when he pleased and as he pleased, either in bed or in the breakfast-room, lounging through the morning, playing duets with Blanche, sorting her worsteds for her, or teasing her about the grotesque figures she was embroidering and calling shepherd boys and girls. What she had once before said to him upon the subject was nothing when compared with her present anger and scorn, as she assured him again and again that if he married Bessie McPherson, she would at once cut off his allowance and leave him to shirk for himself. On the contrary, he bent every energy to keep the secret from her, and never again mentioned Bessie or Stoneleigh in her presence, but devoted himself to Blanche in a friendly, brotherly kind of way, which kept the peace in that quarter and left him in quiet. Yes, I believe I'll try it." "By Jove, I'll tell her the truth, that I want money in order to marry Bessie," he said, and he took Bessie for his starting paint, and waxed eloquent as he described her sweetness and beauty, and told of her life of toil and care and self-denial at Stoneleigh, with her father, whom he represented as just on the verge of the grave. Flora gasped in a whisper, "it is Betsey, ma'am; it is for you." I know what I am about," was whispered back, and so Bessie McPherson, and not Betsey, was received into Christ's flock and signed with the sign of the cross, and given to the happy mother happier than she dared to own because of the change of name. Betsey is not very poetical, and they are sure to call you Bets when they are angry at you. No, my fine London gentleman! It would degrade him. and she shook her head fiercely at the fire, as she went on: "But the girl, if he tells the truth, is the right kind of stuff, staying at home, caring for her father, wearing shabby clothes, and even washing the dishes, which I have no doubt hurts him the most. "The work is not hard," she wrote. My will is made, and I do not often change my mind. He was very attentive to Blanche and very kind to his mother, and he wrote long letters to Bessie three times a week, and went to church every Sunday and gave a half-penny to every little ragged child he met, and felt that Neil McPherson was a pretty good fellow after all. Why, that is not much more than mother allows me now, and I am awfully hard up at times. No, Bessie, you must wait a little longer until something turns up, as I am sure there will. "No, child," he said, "it's nothing. Try for him, Bessie; I know you can get him. She wanted money sadly, for her boots were giving out at the sides, and the butcher's bill was unpaid, and her father needed wine and jellies to tempt his sickly appetite and keep up his failing strength. "It was begged; it is a charity; it burns my hand," she said, as she held the note between her thumb and finger. "But what should I do with father gone?" Bless the child," and Dorothy laughed till the tears ran. Why, we are rich, and father can have everything he wants. "Direct your answer to me," she wrote, "as I transact all my father's business for him." Oh, if he should die, I should die, too!" "Yes, child," he answered, "it is all yours to do with as you please." You could not mean otherwise; but please, Mr. Trevellian, for my sake don't do it again. "Yours truly, "BESSIE McPHERSON." "And I half made up my mind to go," Daisy wrote to Bessie in May. By the way, I saw Trevellian the other day, and when I said something about hoping to pay him his ten pounds soon, he told me you had paid it. Very kind in you, I am sure, but I don't see where you got the money. You might have kept it, as he would never have pressed me for it, and I could not pay it if he did. My rooms cost me so much that I never have a shilling to spare, and I do not go to Monte Carlo often, for these Rossiter-Brownes profess to be very religious peopleâ"Baptists, I believeâ"and hold gambling in great abhorrence, so, as I wish to stand well with them I have to play on the sly, or not at all. Write me soon, and if you can do so please send me a pound or two. What a fool she is, to be sure!" He was usually in a half-unconscious condition now, seldom rousing except to take his meals, or when Bessie made a great effort to interest him, and she did not guess how fast he was failing. "Oh, mother, I am so glad you have come," she cried, and laying her head in her mother's lap, she sobbed passionately for a moment, while she said: "And you will not go away; will not leave me here alone, with no one to speak to all day long but Dorothy. Oh, mother, the loneliness is so terrible and life is so dreary to me." "Your father will not die," she said. "I wish we could show them some attention," Daisy said to her daughter. "Don't you think we might manage a French tea in the garden at four o'clock? "Yes; that was Daisy," he said, "but I have not seen her in many a year. I loved you so much." "And don't you love me now, Archie?" she asked, kneeling beside him with her white arms across his knees, while she looked into his face with the old look she could assume so easily, and which moved even this weak man. she asked, and he replied: "Missed you? Yes; but I have not been unhappy, for I have had Bessie. No man could be unhappy with Bessie, I think I will go in now and find her. Daisy asked, looking curiously at him, as, with closed eyes, he leaned wearily back in his chair and replied: "The birds which sing to me so often; birds of the future, and the past, too, I think they are, for they sing sometimes of you, but oftener of Bessie and a journey far away where she is going to be happy when we are both gone and the winds are blowing across our gravesâ"over there," and he pointed toward the little yard where his father and mother were lying side by side, and where he soon would lie. "There are plenty of ignorant, vulgar women in England, traveling on their money recently acquired, who at heart are not half as good as Mrs. Browne," she said; "and for that matter there are titled ladies too who know precious little more than she. But this she would not permit; and once, when she overheard the remark, "that's a fair sample of them, I suppose," turned fiercely on the knot of ladies who, she knew, were discussing her, and said: "If it's me you are talking up and think a fair sample let me tell you that you are much mistaken. I was poor, and had to work for my livin', and my old blind mother's, too. You are well enough, and nice enough, and on voices you beat us all holler, for 'tis a fact that most of us pitch ours too high and talk through our noses awful, and maybe you'd do that too, if you lived in our beastly climate, but as a rule you have not an atom more learning or refinement at heart than we." He was a queer one too; crazy, some said, and I guess 'twas true. He was sick with fever after it, and everybody thought he'd die. He was crazy as a loon. Yes, that was you, sure! Isn't it droll, though?" They are saying 'Archie, Archie, come,' as if it were my mother calling to me." "Archie," she said, at last, "you love me, don't you? "I am Daisy. "And won't you bless me, too, Archie? I think I shall know it when I take another young Irishman in hand. By the way, he brought me news of the death of Sir Henry Trevellian, of Trevellian Castle, in the north of England He was thrown from his horse and killed instantly Jack Trevellian was with him, and, it is said, was nearly heart-broken, though by this accident he has become Sir Jack, and is master of a fine old place and a tolerably fair fortune. He will be much sought after now, but if ever he comes in your way again, and you play your cards well you may be my Lady Trevellian. "Sir Jack Trevellian," Bessie repeated to herself, while there swept over her a great pity for the poor young man, smitten down so suddenly, while for Jack she was glad, knowing how well he would fill the place and how worthy he was of it. "No, Bessie; never any more warmth for me. I know it now; the end is very near, and the birds are singing everywhere, just as they sang in the summer mornings years ago, when I was a boy. What season is it, Bessie? I would rather die in the summer time just as father and mother did. Bury me by them, Bessie; with no expense, and when Daisy dies lay her by me, too, in the grass where the birds are singing. "She was invited to go by some friends, who bear all the expense. She will not be gone long; only through the summer," Bessie said, trying to find excuse for her mother, but Archie shook his head, and replied: "I shall not be here when she comes back; shall not be here to-morrow; and, oh, my child, what will you do? You cannot live here alone, and my annuity dies with me. His place is here with you, if he is to be your husband. What should she do, and where was Neil, that he made no response to tell her he was coming? Oh, oh, it isn't Neil!" and she gave a little scream of terror and surprise, as, looking up, she met Grey Jerrold's face bending over her instead of Neil's. Grey had been to Carnarvon on the old business, and, moved by a desire to see Bessie's blue eyes again, had come to the "George Hotel" to pass the night, intending to call at Stoneleigh in the morning. "No, it is not Neil," he said, trying to detain her as she drew herself from him. "No, he cannot," Bessie replied. Oh, yes, I know her. He was with us last Christmas, you remember." Give me your hand, Bessie, I want to feel that you are with me to the last." Be kind to her, young man. Good-by; God bless you both." You are so kind. What should I do without you, and what shall I do anyway? "Leave it all to me," he answered her. "Don't give the matter a thought, but try and rest; and when you feel that you can, I will take you back to the house." He was in London, he said, and chanced to be calling at the Trevellian house where he learned that all the family, Neil included, were at Vichy, where Lady Jane had gone for the waters and bathing. Please see that everything is done decently, and send bill to me. I hardly think he is, as he does not like Vichy. He, at least, might come. To the Hon. I must leave here to-morrow for Trevellian Castle, and then Miss Bessie will be quite alone, but I dare say you and Lady Jane will soon arrive to take charge of her. I think Jerrold is hard hit, too; but I mean to get the start of him. "Yours truly, JACK." "Don't remember it now," he said, with a look of deep pain in his eyes and a tremor in his voice, "Believe me, I'd give worlds to bring poor Hal back to life again, and you do not know what anguish I endured during the few moments I held him in my arms and knew that he was dying. "Why not?" You are so quiet, she so wild and frolicsome. I think I have loved you since the day I first saw you in the park and looked into your bright face, the fairest and truest I ever saw. You are so tired and worn, and up there among the hills you would grow strong, and I would surround you with every comfort and make you a very queen. Dear Bessie, answer me. "Don't cry, darling," he said, winding his arm around her and trying to draw her to him. "Don't cry, but answer me; don't you like me a little?" I think you one of the noblest, best of men, and always have thought so since I first knew you, and you were so kind to father and me; but I cannot be your wife." he exclaimed. Hoidenish, do you call me? You cannot help loving him when you know how good he is! Why, if I tried real hard I could love him myself! Oh, Hal. My tears are falling fast for him, and I am so lonely without him. she answered him, sadly, "No, I cannot. "No, Bessie," he replied; "but strange that you should have chosen him. Good-by, Bessie, and forgive me if I have wounded you. I must go now, and with a heavy heart, Flossie will be so disappointed, too." Farewell, and God bless you." You could not pretend to be sorry, and we are not able to do much for the girl; Neil's trip will take all our spare cash," Lady Jane said, as she read the telegram received from Jack, and that decided her better-half at once. "Oh, Neil," she sobbed, "I am so glad, I have wanted you so much, and been so wretched because you neither wrote nor came." Don't cry, Bessie; it hurts me to see you feel so badly. Try and be quiet, and tell me all about it, and what Grey Jerrold and Jack did and said. He will not repeat it. "By Jove, I do not blame you if it is so. But this plan Neil repudiated with scorn. "Your husband died this morning, quietly and peacefully. Archie, my husband!" "Archie is dead, dead!" It would never do to abandon the field to Augusta, she reflected, but her tears flowed just as fast, and, to do her justice, there was a sense of bitter pain in her heart, as she sat with her head bowed down, while the Brownes and Lord Hardy stood around trying to comfort her. Fee 'em high, too, and do it quick! Oh, what shall I do?" Oh, Mrs. Browne, I do want to do right, and you must advise me. "It hurts me to speak of him, but there is a moan in my heart for him all the time." "But it will not be for long," she wrote. "Her mother will bust, if he is. But this was before they had received Mrs. Browne's greeting, which was just as cordial as of old, and her voice was just as loud and hearty. Daisy asked, with a pretty affectation of girlishness, as they left the station; and Allen instantly put the reins in her hands, and leaning languidly back, watched her admiringly, with a strange thrill of something undefinable in his heart. Daisy asked and he replied: "Yes, at a little distance; and we can go very near to it by taking the road across the common," and he indicated the direction. "I wish I had sent her more, and I will by and by," she thought, never dreaming that Archie was dead, or that his wife was so near. Not Allen, surely?" A widow, at any rate." she asked herself, as she resumed her seat and tried to seem natural. I must find out if Archie is dead, and what has become of the girl." Home is home, if it's ever so homely, I tell 'em. By the way, I'm glad you happened this way. "Why didn't she go home at once to her daughter?" She will not stay long, and I hope you'll call soon. "No, I have not. "Oh, excuse me," and Mrs. Browne brightened at once. He is going West, and we persuaded him to stop here first. He is very nice, and not at all stuck up." she began, and the tone was not very reassuring "I knew you were here. Oh, auntie, it almost killed me when I heard he was dead, and there is a moan for him in my heart all the time." Why do you hate me so? You do not show it. Yes, throw them away, or send them back whence they came. You are a widow; you have a grown-up daughter. You are no longer young, though you are good enough looking, but good looks will not support you honestly. I've said my say, and there comes the boy Allen for you. Boy, indeed!" Say, Teddy, are you angry with me?" I am not blind to what you are doing." Daisy asked, and he replied: "Making a fool of a boy, for mercenary purposes of your own. It is not impossible. On the night of his arrival at the hotel, which was very full, he had been given a room on the fourth floor looking into a court, and his rest had been disturbed by the murmur of voices in the room adjoining his own. What is the matter with her?" A severe cold, indeed! What liars they are, to be sure! Grandma is frightened almost to death, and burns sugar, and camphor, and brimstone, as disinfectants, and keeps chloride of lime under her bed, till her room smells worse, if possible, than the hotel itself. My room adjoins Bessie's, and I am with her half the time." "Tell me how long she has been sick, and who is with her." If Neil were here, or my remittances from England would come, it would be all right." "No nurse," Grey exclaimed. Who, then, takes care of her?" "I do, with Miss Meredith's help. It is needless to say that within two hours' time Grey's room was at Daisy's disposal, and the proprietor had orders to charge the same to Mr. Jerrold's account instead of Mrs. McPherson's, while Grey's own luggage was transported to a little, close, eight-by-twelve apartment, which smelled worse than old Mrs. Meredith's could possibly have smelled with all her burnt brimstone and camphor and chloride of lime. and she shivered a little, as she continued, "Where is he, Neil? He was with me when father died, and was so very kind. Thank him for me, when you see him, and now I am so tired. She persisted in thinking him Neil, and Grey humored the fancy. Daisy and Flossie had gone to dinner, and the nurse was resting a few moments in the adjoining room, while Grey sat by her patient; thus he was alone with Bessie, when she startled him with the question, "Why don't you kiss me, Neil?" Grey had seen much of the world, and many bright eyes had flashed upon him glances which mean so much, but which had never affected him. "Hush, Flossie!" You say Mr. Jerrold is here. Grey had not been to the room that morning, but he soon came and was admitted to Bessie's presence. "Don't try," Grey said, sitting down beside her, and placing one of his own broad, warm palms upon the little hands, as if he would thus communicate to them some of his own strength and vitality. You were with me when father died I remember all you did for me then, and I prayed God to bless you for it many a time; and now, I am going where father has gone, and shall sleep by him in the little yard at home, for they will take me back; mother has promisedâ"I could not rest here in Rome, lovely as the grave-yard is. He will care for youâ"and youâ"youâ"will keep your promise?" "Yes, child; so help me God!" Daisy answered, excitedly. We should all love you so much, my mother, Aunt Lucy, Aunt Hannah, and all." "I am not going to trouble you now; you are too weak for that. Write me at Venice, Hotel New York, and tell me how she is. On the morning when he left the hotel he had seen the nurse, and inquired after the patient, who, she reported, had slept well and seemed a little better. the girl he loved so much. "If I were only there," he thought. It would be a relief to talk to him, Grey thought. "What is it, old fellow?" Crossed in love, hey? "Hush, Jack!" Oh, Grey!" I seem to be terribly unstrung, it is so sudden and awful. I think I have loved her since I first saw her, a demure, old-fashioned little thing, in the funniest bonnet and dress you ever saw, sitting with her father, in Hyde Park, and looking at the passers-by. "No; oh, no" Jack groaned, "If she had, she might not now have been dead; my Bessie, whom I loved so much. I see it in your face." "Oh, Neil," she said, with a sob, "you are not afraid of me?" "You did not kiss her, of course?" she continued, with the utmost gravity. Grandma is afraid, like you, so I know all the preventives. You can find one at any grocer's: put it in a bit of cloth, with a piece of camphor-gum, and wear it over the pit of your stomach. You can endure a great deal in order to feel safe," Flossie replied. I'll fix it for you." "Sir Jack told me he was a milksop and not half worthy of Bessie, and he was right. I think him an idiot. Leeks, indeed! I think I will retire; good-night;" then, clasping her hands together, she began the prayer of her childhood: "Now I lay me down to sleep," repeating the whole distinctly, while, with the words, "I pray thee, Lord, my soul to take," she went to meet the God who is so pitiful and kind, and who knew all the good that was in her, and knew, too, what thoughts of remorse for the past and prayers for forgiveness had been in her heart during the few lucid intervals which had been given to her. Oh, am I going to die? Don't; don't." Bury me by Archie in the grass, it is so quiet there; and now it is getting late. I think I will retire. "Why not?" As it is, I dread going to her with all these heavy bills. "There is nothing for me to do; absolutely nothing." "Don't other men find employment if they want it?" But, jesting aside. It is no disgrace to work there, and your friends will never know." "I am not sure of that," Neil said. "But what do you mean to do?" "Anything I can find," Bessie answered, decidedly. I assure you. She wrote to him at Venice, but he did net answer her letter. "But you are not to fall in love with him," he continued, laughingly. he exclaimed, taking her hand and putting it under his arm, "how can I let you go? he exclaimed, glancing down upon her and stopping suddenly. Many respectable people go out that way, and it is very comfortable. Why do you look at me so strangely, Neil? "No, Neil, I cannot. Will that do? "Neil, I am not," Bessie answered, firmly. "Not in that wayâ"no," Bessie replied. "It seems to me I have been in the steerage all my life, and this can be no worse. We will be friends always, as we are cousins, but never man and wife. You cannot help me any, andâ"" she hesitated an instant, and then added: "You might be recognized." I know you will never forget me. Good-by." "Don't get out; good-by," she said, waving him back as he was about to alight, and opening her umbrella and pulling the hood of her waterproof over her head, she started in the direction of Mrs. Goodnough, leaving Neil with such a tumult of thought crowding his brain as nearly drove him wild. "So glad I happened to meet you," Grey said. "I wanted to say good-by, for I am off for America." Neil repeated, and his lower jaw dropped suddenly, as if he had been seized with paralysis. "Oh, I cannot bear itâ"I cannot. "Oh, can't I go back? there, darling! Oh, me poor old father, I wish I had niver come. Is your father old, and why did you leave him?" I know 'em. They are on every ship, and they are on this. Cultivate me, indade! Let him come anigh you or me, the bla'guard!" On the contrary, she felt comforted because of it, and because of Jennie, whose faithfulness and devotion knew no stint or cessation during the next twenty-four hours, when it seemed to Bessie that she must die, both from the terrible sea-sickness and the close atmosphere of the cabin, where so many were congregated. It's just stalin', and nothin' else." "An' sure she'll be throwin' up ivery blessed thing she'll ate for the next year," she said. "Here, honey! My nephew Grey has been sick all the voyage, or I should have been down here before. and was he there on the ship with her, and would he know by and by that she was there and come to see her? I had no money for a first-class ticket, and so I came in here. They are very kind to me, Jennie and Mrs. Goodnough. Please go away, or I shall break my promise to Neil." Grey had been very sick the entire voyage. But this he had not done, and Bessie's name had never passed his lips since he heard she was dead. He was going to Wales on business, he said, and as she knew he had been there two or three times before, Lucy asked no questions, and had no suspicion of the nature of the business which took him first to Carnarvon, where a last fruitless search was made for Elizabeth Rogers or some of her kin, and then to Stoneleigh, which he reached on an early morning train, the same which took Bessie to Liverpool! Good-by, darling; good-by." He was better, and was going on deck as soon as the steward could come and help him. "Tell me about her if you can. You say she is dead, and you are sure?" "Yes, sure," he answered. But who was she, and who was the Neil of whom she had inadvertently spoken? and why was she so like the Bessie, Grey had described? "What is it? "How does she know my nephew, and who is she?" "It was not right for me to have this large room all to myself, and leave you in that cramped, crowded place," she said, and Bessie answered her: "Yes, it was kind in you, but I am sorry you found me out, I promised no one should know me. "Drat that Neil, whoever he is!" But this Lucy would not allow. He will bring Stoneleigh back to me; he was so kind when father died, and in Rome, and everywhere. "It was the American girl on the same floor with me. Oh, it was so sad; and Mr. Jerrold thought it was I! I must have you well when we reach New York, and we have only three days more," Miss Grey replied, and then, with a kiss, she went away to Grey's state-room at the other end of the ship. "What is it? "No; it has nothing to do with New York, or the ship, but somebody in it. "Go on," he added: "tell me what you mean." "But why did not Neil tell me he had been to see her off?" just for the moment mine, if Neil's by and by." Oh, if I could only call it mine, it should never know toil again." "No, thank you," Bessie replied; "I would rather go to her alone, so that if she is kind I shall know it is to me, and not to you, or because she thinks it will please you." Good-by; God bless ye." She's game, she is." So tell me what you want, and what you expect me to do. She wanted Bessie in a good light, where she could see her face, from which she never took her eyes, as the girl repeated in substance what she had said at first, making some additions to her story, and speaking of the ship in which she had come, but not of Miss Lucy or Grey. "I thought I might teach French, perhaps; and German, I am a pretty good scholar in both," Bessie replied, and her aunt rejoined: "French and German! French, indeed! I am handy with my needle, I have made all my own dresses, and Dorothy's, too." You do not know how greatly I desire it, or how poor I am. It is not clothes I want. "Did he break it, or you?" "I broke it," was the low response. You can go up there at once if you like, and I will see that your trunks are brought from the station." "It was meant for you years ago, when I wrote to your father and asked him to give you to me. You had better go to bed, and not come down again." I was very tired, and the bed was so nice. "No, thanks. I am through. You can clear the table if you like," Miss Betsey replied, shoving back her chair and eyeing her niece curiously as she gathered up the dishes and carried them to the kitchen, where she took her own breakfast with the cook, who instructed her in her duties as well as she could. "Oh, mother! Don't cry. She wants to see you. Wash your face, and take off your apron and come down." "What is the matter with Mrs. I know Geraldine Jerrold pretty well, and if I's Hannah I wouldn't run to every beck and call, when nothing under the sun ails her but hypo. Burton Jerrold has got his hands full, and I pity him. You've seen him, I b'lieve?" "There goes as nice a woman as ever lived made over into a fool by money and a little nincompoop of a lord," was Miss Betsey's comment, as she watched the carriage moving away across the common. "No; perfectly right," Miss Betsey said: "and now tell me all about it. Oh, auntie, he is the noblest man I ever knew. My work is done, and now, if you have any sewing, please let me have it." she asked, as she saw the great tears roll down Bessie's cheeks faster than she could wipe them away. Oh, auntie, if I could die! What is mine is yours, so long as my opinion of you remains unchanged. You made me play, you know.' "After that I was silent and watched him sadly, as the infatuation increased. "What is it?' I asked, as I opened the door and looked at his white face. "'Sister,' he said, stepping into the room. "How I knew it I cannot tell, but know it I did. He was just a fortune-hunter, she said, and cared no more for Augusta Browne than he did for her, except that Augusta was the younger of the two, and she could not forget how he had looked, smirking and mincing by the side of Archie's wife at Aberystwyth; poor, weak Daisy, who, but for him, might not have gone so far astray as she did. Since we last saw him, years ago, the Rev. "Grey, my boy, how are you?" Yes, she has had a hard life. You do not think she will die?" "No," she said; "I do not believe she will die. Sit down and wait till she is awake." Grey exclaimed, and slipping a bill into the girl's hand, he continued: "Take good care of her, Jennie, and when she is able tell her I came to see her." "An' sure I'll tell her ivery blessed word, and that you left your love." Nobody to care for you, indade, with the gentry comin' every day to inquire for you, the praste a readin' his prayers in this very room, and the foine gintleman who was on the ship a sittin' down stairs three mortal hours waitin' to know if you waked up dead or alive, and thankin' God when it was alive I told him you was." "Who, Jennie? "Oh, how lovely it is! On the wall, beside Blind Robin's, there was a picture of Grey, taken in Europe when he was fourteen, and just before the great sorrow came upon him and robbed his face of a little of the assurance and boyish eagerness which the artist had depicted upon the canvas. Grey had come to Allington from Springfield, where he had been on business for his father, and both Lucy and Miss McPherson knew that he was coming, and had chosen that day for Bessie's visit to the park, and had purposely talked before her of his probable marriage, in order to test the nature of Bessie's feelings for him. he answered, interrogatively, as he regarded her with astonishment. she continued. Grey exclaimed, starting to his feet. "What is it, Bessie? he asked, in some surprise, and Bessie answered him: "Your Aunt Lucy said she thought so, and Iâ"oh, Grey, what must you think of me?" Will that be at Christmas-time, do you think?" He was taking everything for granted, and Bessie knew that he was, and knew what he meant, but she would scarcely have been a woman if she had not wished him to put his meaning in words which could not be mistaken, so she said to him amid her tearsâ"glad, happy tears they were now: "Whom are you to marry?" Then, going up to Miss McPherson, he continued: "Kiss me, Aunt Betsey because I am to be your nephew, and because I am no longer a fool." Like his wife, he did not object to Grey's engagement. "There she is; that is Aunt Hannah," Grey said, as a tall, slender woman, in a plain black dress, came to the open door and stood waiting for them. "And I should have known her, too. What a sad face it is, just as if there was a history hidden under it." she asked, laying her hand upon the door which was always closed. "Why did she make that remark, of all others?" He was only waiting for her to come in before he commenced, she knew, and putting the picture back in its place, she went down to the south room, and taking her seat beside Bessie, as Grey motioned her to do, waited for him to begin. he asked, and Bessie replied: "A disgrace! Oh, Grey, you surely do not mean that!" Where did he live, and had he no friends to make inquiries for him?" "Oh, Grey!" He was a good bit older than I am,' Anthony said, 'and would be over eighty if living now.' "A picture, did you say? Then, giving the key a turn or two, she continued: "It does. It ticks. Look, Grey," and she held it to his ear. "He must have had two taken, one for himself and one for her. "There is money for me somewhere, but, oh, I wish it had come in father's life-time. "No, why should it? Oh, Grey, you are not going to give me up because of that? He was to sail the last week in November, and as, when he engaged his state-room, nothing had been said about a second one for Mrs. Browne, he comforted himself with the hope that she did not meditate going with him. "Don't for pity's sake, ask any more of the scum," Allen said, adding, that if she had not invited any of them no one would have been slighted. On the whole, however, everything went smoothly, and the grand affair came off one November night when the air was as soft and balmy as in early summer, and the full moon was sailing through a cloudless sky as carriage after carriage made its way to the brilliantly lighted house through the dense crowd of curious people which filled the road in front, and even stretched to the left along the garden fence. "Why, I am rich!" She meant to give it away, and make a great many people happy. Oh, Grey, honestly I did not want you here one bit. "No, Grey, if I had not met you, I could not have married Neil. I think you ought to write and tell him, and perhaps invite him here for the holidays. "No, Bessie. My mother advising me to work, after all her training to the contrary. This, at his age, is very hard, and I am sorry for him. I am not that kind, and it would do no good. You were too good for me, Bessie, and I should have been a drag upon your life always. She and mother had a jolly row, of which I fancy I was the cause. "But what nonsense I am writing, and it is time I closed. I hear father in his room, and guess it must be time for his tea, so I will go in and join him. "Forever and ever yours, "Neil." He keeps a lot of hounds, and has invited me to visit him. "P.S. No. This, I take it, is right shabby in him. Between you and me, he was awfully afraid of mother. Poor mother, she meant well, and she was fond of me. I think I can. "Again yours, forever, "Neil." I would rather be your wife than the grandest duchess in the world, but I am thinking of Neil and his father, and how hard it is for them to be so poor. "Yes, do what you like. What is it, darling?" Poverty is hard to bear, but it will not hurt him. On the contrary, having to work for his living will bring out the very best there is in him, and make him a man. He will not starve or even suffer want on three hundred pounds a year; it is more than many a working man has with a large family to support. Now, this is my suggestion; Anthony and Dorothy ought to have some one with them in their old age. Grey, however, had no such scruples. I think 'Bessie Jerrold' the sweetest name in all the world." He is greatly changed, and does not seem like himself at all. I think, however, that for the winter I shall remain in London, where I hope to see you and Mr. Jerrold, whose father and mother I met years ago at Penrhyn Park. He was very fond of Bessie, whom he always called "dear child," and once, when she stood by him, he put his arm about her and kissing her fondly said, "I wish you could have been my daughter; it would have been the making of Neil." Good-by." Good-by, and may God bless you and make you the happiest woman in the world, as you deserve to be. I may never see you again, and I may. Good-by." I think you will succeed in India, but if you fail, try America. You are sure to succeed there, if you only have the will, and I can help you some, perhaps. Good-by." Nobody could communicate with him, for when he wrote to his steward, as he did sometimes, he never said where a letter could reach him, or where he was going next. he exclaimed; 'what are you about, and what is this you have hitched to me?' You were with her, I believe?' Grandma said he was in love with you, and I think so, too. he asked. "I wish you could come to the wedding, and so does Jack. 'Ah, bien; je suis contente.' So, good-by. Lady Hardy, who is not with her. Once more, good-by, FLORENCE MEREDITH." Grey had reached Allington the previous day, and found his mother there waiting to receive him. "I wanted your father to come with me, but he would not. "Grey, my boy, how are you? Twelve years ago, and for twelve years I have been sickâ"very sick. Oh, Grey, if I dared to tell you, and ask you what to do!" "You need not tell me," Grey said to him. Well, that was what ailed me. Listen, and I will tell you all." Oh, Grey! You do not know what a load of care you have taken from me, for, though my father's sin is none the less, it does not hurt me as much, and I feel as if I could forgive him all. The peddler struck him first, you know. I must see Hannah, and hear the story again. "Oh, Burton, how glad I am to see you! Grey has told me everything, and I feel like a new man. We should have lived it down, though I might never have married Geraldine and never have had Grey. No, sister, you did right, and having kept it so long, we must keep it still. "It can do no good to any one, so let the poor man rest in peace. By the way, shall you live here, or with Grey?" He was very fond of her, always calling her daughter when he addressed her, and when, after dinner was over, she came and sat at his side, and laying her hand on his, said to him, "Father, there is something I very much wish to do, and I want your consent," he answered, unhesitatingly: "You shall have it, no matter what you ask." "I thought you would not oppose me, even if Grey did. Why, I am almost sixty." "But just as dear and young to me as if you were sixteen," was the reply of the Rev. Yes, I am very glad for you, little Bessie McPherson." Come down directly, or I'll be afther helpin' ye!" "Oh, Neil, I am so gladâ"and so sorry, too. There, let me help you, too." What is your name, my little man?" I say, 'God bless Uncle Neil,'" the child continued. He was very tired, and sank down upon the inviting looking lounge, saying as he did so: "Oh, Bessie, you do not know how glad I am to be here with you and Grey; nor yet how it affects me. I am not always as bad as this. He will be having all his meals in his room, first you will know. You do not know how weak, and sick, and changed he is. "Did he do that?" He was her own flesh and blood, nearer to her even than Bessie; he was sick; he was subdued; he had crossed as a second-class passenger, and this went further toward reconciling her to him than anything he could have done. "Why Neil, my boy," she said, as she took both his hands, "I am sorry to see you so weak. Sit down; don't try to stand; or rather, lie down, and I will sit beside you." I saw Jack, too, that day; did I tell you? He was staying in London, at Langham's, and Flossie was with him. Nobody would miss me. "Don't interrupt me, and do not misunderstand me. I know you and Grey would be sorry just at first, but you have each other, and you have your children. You could not miss me long, or be sorry except for my wasted life. No, Bessie. I would far rather die, and I think I shall." Neil replied, as he leaned back in his chair. You are only fit to live with me, and see to my business. You can do this. It is not hard, and will pay in the end. In short, I want you for my son, or grandson, if you like that better. Jack, you don't know what a lovely woman Bessie is.
