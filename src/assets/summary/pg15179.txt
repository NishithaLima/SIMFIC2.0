 I am so glad he is gone! It is not a pretty face; even my friends do not think me beautiful. But it is a social success which I have slowly gained, with much labor, and its duration is somewhat uncertain. But, O, my! But that was not all. Of course you can have one nice, white dress, and change the ribbonsâ"sometimes pink, sometimes blue, or any color that may happen to strike your fancyâ"but sooner or later people will find that out; they will just know it's the same dress with other ribbons, and it's a social deception which fashionable society-idiots just will not tolerate. People said it was going to be crude, perhaps disagreeable. I was not when I played at the last musicale. He was by my side the entire evening at Mrs. Babbington Brooks's elegant and most fashionable ball the other night; he was my escort to the musicale last Tuesday, and O, he did look so handsome! Ah, here is a note from him now! He always writes from the Clubâ"the Pelham, of course. Of course I'll go with him; for to go with Robert Fairfield any where means a delightful time to any girl so fortunate. As for myself, I would never go any where if I had to, for the lack of a man, always be dragging poor papa out. It must be so very mortifying. But she has a gracious and pleasant manner, and sometimes has a good deal of attentionâ"whenever she once gets out. People frequently say nice things about her; but I am sure it's their duty, because she entertains charmingly and often. O, the hypocrite! They are both hypocrites; we are all hypocrites! They are out of sight! It's all nonsense, any how! No, no, NO! Of course I talk entirely too muchâ"no one knows that any better than I doâ"yet I can not help it! As for Aunt Patsey, she is always after me! "Not good form, my dear, not good form!" They are all real hard on me! I am so unlucky talking. My, it will be so exciting! Pa says I told it, myself. But she must love to do useless things, for she just keeps right on. People can't frown me downâ"no indeed, double deed, not if Alice Wing knows any thing about herself! People who know me never try; except my family, headed by Aunt Patsey, who always says, "We are prompted by a deep sense of duty, my dear, duty!" He is so timid! They nearly always have a solemn, almost scared lookâ"but I really don't know why! People who have good manners are so safeâ"they never do any thing startling! Yet, I know it is very effective! I ought by this time. He was in a bad humor anyhow; had not seen enough of Miss Lena! You were, indeed, a very apt scholar! Of course I know that it is all wrong, yet after all there is a certain kind of satisfaction. my dear doves," sets me fairly wild. They are invited every where; and only last season people were turning up their noses and asking, "Who, pray, are the Brookses?" They are not yet quite sure of their position! They are afraid it will not be permanent! To me there is always something very fascinating about these desperate social strugglersâ"especially when they are successful. But she don't know every thing, for Mrs. John Robert Gilder has fooled her. As they say in novels, it will go down to my grave with me. I am so anxious about Sophia, I am afraid it may take her there. Mr. Fairfield is polite to me, and that is about all. He is quiet, but not one bit stupid. He talks little, but oh, he is such an attentive listener! He don't come after me, so I can't run after him. But, my, my! Sis, you had better skip, and pretty quick, too! See now, all this comes of telling the family secrets. But it was not a slander, it was all the truth; just as true as gospel. But she is coming; this house won't hold us both just now, so I am off via back stairsâ"to dine with my dear Sophia Gilder, if I don't find that fraud, Mrs. Babbington Brooks, there ahead of me. I was incorporated by the "social legislature" four winters ago. Mamma was the active, successful lobbyist. My father was the silent, financial lever absolutely necessary for the passage of the billâ"opposition small. My reputation is better, alas! than I deserve. I constantly make loans, but I never sell. 1 in every respect. It is collateral, not indorsements which I require. It is my sweet expectation to retire from business whenever I chance to findâ"or rather when I am foundâ"by the right purchaser. I rapidly get them into the line of march, ready for immediate use. Men are willing to be deceived, but it must not be a labeled deceit. He is flattered. He joins me. But I do not yield. He is within my power! But I do not love him. He is wise, but Iâ"I am a woman, and a woman of the world. The tide grows too strong. They are not sufficient proof in any court of conscience, law, or public opinion. They are the glorious privileges of a woman who is a Private Corporation, Flirting for Revenue Only. ah, after all, old things are best. He was young, attractive, somewhat wild, and quite the fashion that year, and in fact ever since. She always disliked him, and on that one subject has always been unreasonable. But she has more influence over me than he has, or ever could have. He is somewhat devoted to a half dozen or more of our best young women, and they are all more or less devoted to him. And did we, or not? In short, do we? Sleep on, sweet Conscience, sleep on! A.B. Of course, I am nothing of a belle, nothing of a social queen among women. I go to the utmost limit, and sometimes beyond. I am invited every where, because we belong to a highly respectable and somewhat ancient family we have a beautiful family-tree, arranged by mamma before I was grown ; and I go every where, even when I am forced to go with papa, which, I am glad to say, is never more than twice in one season. Papa is really a dear, good man. He was, even when they married, counted among the rich men of the community. She may not be lovable, but she is magnetic. She forces homage from all, devotion from many. But she is an evil magnet; and she is conscious of her power, which she wields in a high-handed and a most unscrupulous manner. But she does not fool mamma. Her methods are bold, startling, successful. She wanted recognition. It came. but, fortunately, other people don't know her as we doâ"papa and I. Mamma used to be unkind, but now she is cruel. It is her last effort in my behalf. I am superficial, but she is not. She reads each good book itself, not the criticism only. She reads it carefully, thoroughly, as few other people ever do. She kissed me. But it is folly to run counter to the social current. It is hard to do, but it can be, and it must be done. I was nervousâ"rebellious. I was in one of my morbid moods. She always takes the lead, and I, always weak enough to follow. I did not look up; I knew who he was. He made to me an unspoken appeal. But it was not briefly told. It ought not have been told at all; but I am human, so human. I was nothing to him; he was every thing to me; I loved him, I love him. A Cold Gray Study. I did not lack wealth and family position, but I was awkward and not beautiful; in short, ugly. I did not know myself. I had a little individuality of my own, but for a time did not know it. He was a man just a trifle above the average in looks and manners, intellectâ"every thing. He was always attractive and agreeable. He was always making a graceful effort to please, and He wasâ"with meâ"always successful. He was four and twenty, yet he was a genuine boy. He was full of a boy's love and full of a boy's charming susceptibility. He was responsive to the different natures of many women. He was peculiarly a loveable man. I am one of the number. Twice has he courted me, and twice have I refused him. I was invited to dine with the family. Both were bravely denied him. I told him that he was mistaken; I told him he did not, and never would, have for me the grand passion of his life. But it is all a very old story now. I was unconscious of my power, yet I did not know how to accomplish my end. So Gerome left me. I was unable to keep him. I fear, also, to my heart. People said that Gerome had never loved meâ"simply trifling. Then was my opportunity. He thought me cold, but he thought me kind. He was an idle, indifferent, Social Drifter. He was an artist by profession; his inclinationâ"and his leisureâ"made him more of a diletante than any thing else. He was more notorious than famous. But perhaps I should have loved him if he had been the one, and tolerated him longer if he had been the other. He was aggressive; he was open, direct always; he was not blunt, yet he was free from the all-prevalent use of the preliminary. He loved me! He made no concealment of the fact to me, or indeed to others. He loved me, was proud of it, and glad to have all know of it. Of course this was just what I wanted, for he was not a susceptible man. I was deliberate, artistic. I was cold. I led him on blindly. He was always considerate and I hated him for his consideration. He was always thoughtful, unselfish, and alas, always loving. Of course there had been no love in my heart for this man, but his delicate attentions were always intensely flattering. Now was my chance. Revenge, when delayed, is all the sweeter for the delay. I had waited long and patiently, but I had not wasted my time. She had dismissed him after a highly tragic scene. She had done with him, and forever. how sweet were those declarations to my ear. I was not the woman he had known and halfway loved beforeâ"for I had eagerly tasted deep and long of the Egyptian flesh-pots, and I refused any other kind of social sustenance. I was, in truth, a cool, quiet reaction. I coaxed him into believing me to be full of a gentle, womanly purity. He was grateful. He was mine for the taking. We were silent. I was in a mood to yield. One word, a hand-touch, and I would have loved him and bound myself to him for weal or woe! I told him so, and sent him away. He was angry, surprised, disappointed. He promised to try again, but under her direction and according to her selection. But, ah! One word from her andâ"but, go marry. But au revoir, Gerome Meadows. I was born to a position. It is mine by right of inheritance. He was a well-known, important factor in the home of his adoption. My father is a great man. It is not a greatness hedged in by a local limit; he is known far and wide. Social Drifters. Men Unsuccessful. Sympathy Seekers. Sympathy Finders. People Of The Army. People Of The Navy. Bohemians, Ragged As To Their Cuffs, Unkempt As To Their Raiment. All Classes, Shades And Conditions Of Life. In Short, A Strange Kaleidoscopic Circle. I am interested always, but I am never susceptible. My own intuitions are strong, but I want my knowledge to be stronger. I want to know all there is to know about men, women, and things. After all it is not such a hard thing to do. A genuine, cynical touch has, here of late, fallen into my life. It is not an affectation. For they are in reality my subjects. They are ready to fight for me and my causeâ"if I had one. They are contented with their lotâ"because ignorant of any other. They are resentful of all innovationsâ"because they are narrow-minded and full of deep ruts; they are guiltless of one clever thought; they sometimes stumble into somewhat of a clever action, but humbly deprecate the move, unconscious of having done a clever thing. They were the foolish moths, I the candle-flame. They are content with whatever they get; they are entirely harmless, always useful in some way, and occasionally quite interesting. He is sometimes sympathetic, more frequently antagonistic. They are really necessary to my happinessâ"not individually, but as an entirety. Some of them are foolishly constant. They are not foolish on account of their constancyâ"a most commendable traitâ"but because of their inability to know just when to make a display of their devotion. To me the explanation is plain. Of course, when the answer is yes, they both feed on the thought of marriage until its consummation. Those things come, if come they can, of themselves. It is often done. But it is always a fleet-footed fancy. But it is of no use. They are Platitudes of the first water. They never dine or lunch with me, my Pleasures and other Platitudes. I leave out my retinue, the Kaleidoscopic Circle, and tell them about it afterward. They are crude, uncultured creatures, but full of excellent points. Of course he talks all the time about how he made his money. Men Unsuccessful look to me for new inspiration, new hope. They are always interesting. They are mental fragments flung aside by God, and by Him held downâ"so they tell me. They are bitter, cynical, and nearly always dyspeptic. They are near of kin to my Sympathy Seekers, who are pale, light-haired creatures, continually making appeals for sympathy. They are generally silent, melancholy men. They are always bearable, unless they chance to be in love with some other woman, and make me, along with a dozen other people, their one and only confidant. Then is my life made a burden. Of course all this is wearing, yet it is very interesting. I was not able to hold him, nor did I wish or even dare to keep him. He is scornful of the world. After all, I may have idealized and overrated him. Ergo, the cynicism and scornfulness of the world. They are full of twists and notions. People Of The Army and People Of The Navy are valuable to have around, for the sake of looks and manners. They never disappoint you. My Bohemians are my chief delight, and they are many. This, in brief, the retinue.
