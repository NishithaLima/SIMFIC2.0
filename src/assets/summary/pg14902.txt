 "Yes, we will admit that the reds are not of saintly origin," said Fearless Frank, with a quiet smile. "Exactly. Boys, we must investigate this matter." retorted Frank, contemptuously. "I wouldn't be as mean as you for all the gold in the Black Hills country, say nothin' about that in California and Colorado." "Ha! ha!" "She, you say?" said the youth, bending forward in a listening attitude. "Now, then, we will find out the secret of the racket in this thicket." And this was not all, either. Ha! ha! ha! isn't that rich, now? Ha! ha! ha! Why, 'pon my word it is a sight for sore eyes. Ha! ha! he said, applying the spurs to his horse. Ha! ha! ha! isn't that rich, now? Ha! ha! ha! But, why the use of yelling? "Oh! "Ah! "Ah! "Hello!" "Nobody, as I know of. was the significant retort, and the youth laid a cocked six-shooter on the table in front of him. "Go on, gentlemen; don't let me be the means of spoiling your fun." The gambler uttered a curse, and dealt out the pasteboards. The game between Mr. Redburn and the gambler progressed; the eyes of he whom we have just described were on the card sharp constantly. "Good, I suppose." "Oh! no. said the other, decisively. "You'll lose the next round, mark my word." "Ha! ha!" "Hello!" "Exactly," said Harris, calmly. he said, briefly, "isâ"" "Harry Redburn." "Oh! no!" said Harris, sternly; "go onâ"you must salt that card-sharp, or I'll certainly salt you!" said Harris, after a moment. Look! follow me, Henry, and I'll nose our way out of here." "Hello!" ho! whoa up thar, pilgrims! Once outside, Ned Harris led the way. he said, dodging along the shadowy side of the street; "we'll have to scratch gravel, for them up-range 'toughs' will follow us, I reckon. But, tell me, why did you force me to shoot that gambler?" he exclaimed, warmly. nodded Harris, with a quizzical stare. "Yes, she's an odd one. Is here, there and everywhere, seemingly all at one time. "I do not know; few in Deadwood do. Come, let's be going." he said, and seizing the animal by the bit he led horse and rider into a black, gaping fissure in one side of the canyon, that had hitherto escaped Redburn's notice. he demanded, after what seemed to him a long while. "There's my coop, pilgrim. There you will be safe for a time, at least." "Oh, Ned!" she gasped, trembling, as she saw him, "how you frightened me. "How is it that you are up so early, dear?" He approached the cabin, and Redburn went out to find who he was. nodded General Nix, for it was he with a grin. "Through ther pass," and the General chuckled approvingly. Certainly she was in trouble! You, and at such work as this?" retorted the youth, fearlessly, "on whom you have been inflicting one of the most inhuman tortures Indian cunning could conceive. For shame, chief, that you should ever assent to such an actâ"lower yourself to the grade of a dog by such a dastard deed. For shame, I say!" "It shall be as he says. "Oh! "They whipped me, terribly!" When he had finished, the rescued captive seized his hand between both her own, and thanked him warmly. "Nothing, lady; nothing that I think of at present. Certainly it was, and I deserve no thanks. ha! ha! good joke. "No. "I do not." "I fear it will be a hard matter to find him, then. Was he blind, deaf or dumb? "Oh! I am of little or no consequence, you know." "Exactly. yes; it is horrible." "But, it is harmless. Anita looked up into his handsome face, wonderingly. "Yes, sir; but how can you know him? Few do, in Deadwood." "Nevyer mind that, my puss. Anita looked at Redburn, doubtfully. "Exactly!" "Sart'in not, sart'in not! "Wal, let me see. "Oh! yes, sir. Certain it was that she had a secret, but what it was Redburn could not guess. he said in a husky whisper, and a glance convinced Harry that he was still asleep, although his eyes were wide open and staring. he said, seizing a hatchet and stake, "we are about to discover the gold-mine, and our fortunes;" with a merry laugh. The same faultless elegance in dress, the same elaborate display of jewels, and the same haughty, aristocratic bearing produced in one was mirrored to the other. He will be revengeful, too!" "Bah! I fear him not, old as I am. Well, we'll attend to her after we git him out of the way. He is the worst obstacle to our path, at present. "Was she?" echoed Filmore, senior. "Yes, we are armed, if that is what you mean." "Hey!" yelled a rough voice from within the stage "w'at d'ye drive so fast fer? "You'll floor a hoss ef ye don' mind sharp!" rings back, tauntingly. Two words this time, in the same clear, commanding voice. "You do well to stop, Bill McGucken!" the road-agent, observes, reining in his steed. "I expected you hours ago, on time." "Nothin', yer honor. Only a stageful uv passengers, this trip." "Bah! Get down from off the box, there!" The driver trembled, and hesitated. "Ha, ha, ha!" "Bill McGucken, you should join the regular army, you are so brave. Ha, ha, ha!" said the Prince of the Road, coolly, after the laugh, "go you to the passengers who grace this rickety shebang and take up a collection. cried one. "No! no!" yelled another, "well do no such a thing. "Hey!" He is not seriously wounded even!" "Yas, yas, it's his funeral!" Boys, haul down the two, and bind them securely." "Drive on, you cowardly loutâ"drive on. Now, go!" If so, his wishes were fulfilled. he shouted, loudly. he at last whispered, when none of those ahead were glancing back. Of course Deadwood receives a larger share of all this immigrationâ"nothing is more natural, for the young metropolis of the hills is the miner's rendezvous, being in the center of the best yielding locates. The game was poker. he said, with a light laugh, as he raked in the stakes. "This takes your all, eh?" said the "Cattymount"â"for it was heâ"with an oath. Maybe your luck will return, if you keep on. "There, now, go ahead with your funeral. It's your deal." He is not he, but insteadâ"Calamity Jane. he cries, slapping another X onto the pile with great enthusiasm; "I hed a grate, grate muther-in-law w'at played keerds wi' Noar inside o' thet eyedentical whale's stummickâ"played poker wi' w'alebones fer pokers. Wa'al, I jest about reckon I do. no. "I reckon. "Bully, Ned! See! "Ha! ha! ha!" ha! ha! added Ned, facetiously. "At them! "Rip, dig an' gouge 'em. ho! we'll see now who'll swing, we will! At 'em, b'yees, at 'em. How is it with you, lady?" "The same as with you, I guess. No! "Oh! no! no! See! Take out your pistol, aim steadily, and fire twice at my breast. he sneered, biting his lip with vexation. "No, Ned Harris, I will do nothing of the kind. Take my life, if you choose; it is yours. "No! no! But, tell me, Harris about her. We-l-l, yes, if you can call staying living. "Pardon me; miss, pardon me. retorted Ned, bitterly. he cried, fiercely. "I am ready, always, sir. retorted Ned, as cool as ever, while his enemy was all trembling with excitement. was the prompt decision. And most wonderful to relate, he succeeded. "Yes, yes!" "Exactly. Of course thar'll be more or less expense, heerafter, but et'll be a consider'ble less o' more than more o' less. Look! said Redburn, watching the new-comer keenly. He ken't go back now, nohow we kin fix et. he said, addressing Nix, "and call every man to his arms. If it is to be a fight for our rights, a desperate fight it shall be." "Oh! don't fight. "I would, for one, Mr. he said, catching up her hand and pressing it to his lips. "Those words, few as they are, make me happy, Miss Anita. But, stop! "You do," replied Redburn, bowing stiffly. "No, I dare say not. "I did not intend to intrude, sir, nor do I now. "Oh, no! nor my sister, either. "Yes, that is the title I sail under. Why, turn back, I suppose; I see nothing else to do." "No, indeed;" Frank's face flushed, half angrily. Do you know them? The same gang whom the Pioneer is making such a splurge over, every week." "The same. I reckon I do. Give me your decision, and I will go and see what they want." he said, using positiveness in his argument; "that is, not for awhile. Do you know her, or aught of her?" "Iâ"Iâ"I did, once!" was the slow reply. No! he at last said, decidedly. If Anita comes to me, what then?" Pilgrim, you can come along with me." he said, interrogatively, his voice heavy yet pleasant; "I suppose you desire to know what bizness we've got in your cornfield, eh, stranger?" "No, not necessarily so, unless you put yourselves in the way. "If not contrary to your wishes, we should like to, yes." "And what are they, may I ask?" "These. You keep your promise, and all will go well." he demanded, angrily. Think et's all out o' ther bounds o' propriety, do ye?" "I look at it in that light, yes," Redburn replied. No offense, I hope." "I think thet thar ar' bigger prospects yet, in further," the old locater was saying. said Redburn, joining them. he said, tipping his sombrero, but taking care not to let the mask slip from his face. Ah! "But, you are seldom talkative." "Oh! "Yes, when not away on business. Is he as sweet, sad, and silent as yourself?" "Oh! "I do," she answered, at last. he ordered, "and I will soon have her out of this fit." "What do you think about it, "General"?" "Hardly, boyee, hardly. "Yes. Oh, my poor, poor dead brother!" the elder Filmore cried, as he watched the bustle in the valley below. Filmore, the younger, groaned aloud in agony of spirit. "Bah! "I do. He is here in the valley, and he must never leave it alive. She will be just as much in the way, if not a good deal more so." Dick is our game, now." he queried. "Ha, ha!" he said, stepping in front of them, "do not be frightened; don't go, ladies. "No, indeed! "Some time, perhaps, I will tell you, lady, but not now. See! my men are signaling to me, and I must go. "So there are females here, eh?" grunted the elder, musingly. leered the elder Filmore, peering down into the masked faceâ""ha! ha! my young eaglet; so I have you at last, have I? Ha! ha! "No! no! "But, he'll never tell us." Take out his gag. "Now," said the elder Filmore, "just you keep mum. "You'll find out, soon enough, young man. "I think not; when kings win, the game is virtually up. "Don't be too sure of it. But, enough of this cheap talk. Go on and say your say, in as few words as possible, for I am in a hurry." leered the elder, savagely. "Don't be at all scared. Certainly not, sir. he retorted, hotly. "No! No! no! my scheming knaves, I will not. "Bah! we can find her, as we have found you; so we will not trifle. came in a clear, authoritative voice. "One word more than I ask you, and I'll blow your brains out. Now, what's your name?" he echoed, picking up his pipe. "I'm at your service," Frank quickly replied. "I reckon. "A good idea. Well, if you are ready, we'll slide. They propose to quiz a secret about some girl out of him, and then knife him. he counts, savagely. "Don't shoot, Jennie!" When he wants you, we will let you know. Be sure and guard these knaves well, now." Of course, all was now excitement. Hurry, now!" When he was gone, Dick turned to Redburn. "Here they are, Cap!" Anita, yonder; is my sister. And I did fight it. I see now how I was in the wrong. "God bless you, old boy!" he said, huskily. "In time I organized the band of men you see around me, and took to the road. Boys, string 'em up!" I love you, and want you for my own darling. Harris." he said, positively. A merry road-agent I have been, and a merry road-agent I shall die. Now, good-by forever." said the girl, haughtily, sternly. We can be friends, Dick; more we can never be!" Yes, gal, we'll be friends, if nothing more."
